"This first sorting algorithm is the most simple one: Bubble sort consists in "
"progressively moving up the smaller elements of the array, as if they were "
"air bubbles moving up to the surface of a liquid. The algorithm traverse the "
"array, and compare any pair of adjacent elements. If two adjacent elements "
"are wrongly sorted, they are swapped. Once the array was completely "
"traversed, the operation starts again from the beginning. When no elements "
"were sorted after a full traversal, it means that the array is completely "
"sorted: the algorithm can stop.  Bubble sort is studied because of its "
"simplicity, but it is almost never used in practice because of its bad "
"performance (O(n^2) on average)."

"For the algorithm itself, you should first move the hole to the position "
"1. The position 0 is considered to be the sorted area (of size 1 for now) "
"while the area above 2 is the unsorted area.  Then comes an iteration to "
"sort each element of the unsorted area. Since this iteration is a bit "
"complex, you should think of its loop invariant, that is, the condition that "
"is true before and after the loop and which explains that the loop fulfills "
"its goal. Here, the loop invariant is twofold: First, the hole is between "
"the sorted area and the unsorted area, and then, the every elements of the "
"sorted area are ... well sorted relatively to their neighbors."

"Crap, we adapted the insertion sort because our selection sort required too "
"much moves to get the selected players to their position, but the insertion "
"sort requires an inordinate amount of changes to get the border elements to "
"their position within the sorted area without mixing the already sorted "
"elements. At the end of the day, our selection variant was more efficient "
"with at most <code>3*amountOfBase</code> moves to sort one element (1 to get "
"the hole alongside with the player, and 2 to get the hole+player in "
"position) while our insertion variant requires at most "
"<code>3*amountOfPlayers</code> to sort one element (2 to descend the hole "
"and player in position, 1 to get the hole back to its position). That's "
"twice as bad as there is two players per base. It may be possible to improve "
"the insertion sort by moving by more than one element when descending, but "
"it seems uneasy (at least, while not mixing the already sorted elements) and "
"it would probably only ensure that our insertion variant becomes as "
"efficient as our selection variant, not dramatically better."

"If we cannot make the sort faster, we can make it easier. If you think about "
"it, it seems rather natural to adapt the bubble sort to this problem: the "
"hole becomes the bubble that moves up and down, sorting a bit the array "
"during each traversal. The big lines are simply: \"while it's not sorted, "
"move the hole down to base 0 (moving the biggest player of each base at each "
"step) and then back to the maximal base (moving the smallest player of each "
"base)\". After a while, <code>isSorted()</code> will return true and your "

"Surprisingly, the bubble sort variant requires ways less moves than the "

"performs much worse than the others sorts, but it comes from the very good "
