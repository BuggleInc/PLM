<h1>Insertion algorithms and variations</h1>

<h2>ShellSort</h2>
 
This algorithm is named after its author, Donald Shell, who published it in
1959. It can be seen as an application of the CombSort idea (let elements
having a long path to travel take shortcuts) to the insertion sort (CombSort
is a variation of BubbleSort). Instead of comparing adjacent values during
the insertion sort, it compares values separated by a bigger gap. The bigger
the gap, the faster the elements are moved to their final destination, but
also the less precise is this move. It is thus mandatory to apply the
algorithm with a serie of decreasing gaps. At the last step, when the gap is
1, InsertionSort is used, but onto an array which is almost already sorted
by previous steps.

<p>Donald Shell propose <code>len/2</code> as initial value of the gap, and
then to divide it by 2 at each step. The pseudo-code is thus the following:
<pre>
gap=len/2
while gap>0:
  apply InsertionSort, comparing i-gap and i, then i-2gap and i-gap, then i-3gap and i-2gap, etc.
</pre>

<p>Just like in CombSort, the sequence of values taken by the gap is crucial
for Shell sort performance. In some rare pathological cases, the sequence we
used above can lead to a O(n^2) performance. Other sequences were proposed:
the Hibbard's increments of 2k âˆ’ 1 lead to a complexity of O(n^(3/2)) in
worst cases. Pratt's increments 2^i3^j lead to a O(nlog(n)log(n) performance
in worst cases. The existance of a sequence leading to a O(n log(n)) was
precluded by Poonen, Plaxton, and Suel. Thanks to this performance,
ShellSort is a valid candidate for array of several hundred thousands when
correctly implemented.</p>

<p>In our case, the array are ways too small to benefit of these
optimizations. If you ever need to do so, take as initial gap the biggest
value of the targeted serie still smaller than the array size, and then use
decreasing values of the serie.</p>

<p>Interesingly enough, determining the best gap sequence for shell sort turns
into a contemporary research issue in computer science. For example, an
article of 2001 introduces the following sequence, which seems to be optimal
in practice for arrays of size up to 10^5: {1, 4, 10, 23, 57, 132, 301, 701,
1750} (Marcin Ciura, Best Increments for the Average Case of Shellsort, 13th
