<h1>Miscellaneous sorting</h1>

<h2>CombSort</h2>
 
<p>We saw that CocktailSort improve a bit for turtles (i.e. small values near to
the end of the array), but it is still possible to achieve better. ComboSort
comes down to providing them a short cut: instead of comparing adjacent
values, we compare values separated by a gap bigger than 1. That way,
turtles we traverse <i>gap</i> cells at each traversal. Naturally, we have
to apply the algorithm with decreasing gaps, and finish with <i>gap=1</i> to
ensure that the array is correctly sorted afterward. Choosing the right gap
and how to decrease it is a difficult question, but in practice, dividing it
by 1.3 after each traversal leads to good performance. Here is the
corresponding pseudo-code:</p>
 
 <pre>
gap = len;
do
   if gap>1 then
     gap = gap / 1.3
   i = O
   while i+gap &lt; len do:
     if i and i+gap must be swapped, do it
     increase i by the gap
while the gap is bigger than 1 or the last traversal swapped at least one pair
</pre>

<p>This algorithm was invented by Wlodek Dobosiewicz in 1980, and later
rediscovered and popularized by Stephen Lacey and Richard Box, who described
it in Byte Magazine in April 1991.</p>
