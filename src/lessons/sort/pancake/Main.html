<h1>Pancake Sorting</h1>

<p>This activity is inspired by a problem first introduced in 1975 by Harry Dweighter in the American 
Mathematical Monthly. The question is not only to sort the pancakes, but to determine <code>f(n)</code>
the <i>minimal</i> amount of flips mandated to sort any stack of size <code>n</code>.</p> 

<p>This problem is now famous because Bill Gates authored (with C. Papadimitriou) his only 
scientific publication in 1979 on this topic, providing a faster algorithm and proving that <code>17n/16 ≤ f(n) ≤ (5n+5)/3</code>.
This was the only publication of Bill Gates before he invented Windows and became rich.</p>  
 
<p>Then, David X. Cohen, the inventor of the Futurama comics with many mathematical references, introduced 
the variant with burnt pancakes and studied its complexity with Manuel Blum in 1993.</p>

<p>An article of 2011 (by L. Bulteau, G. Fertin and I. Rusu) proved that determining the minimal amount of 
flips to sort the stack is a NP-complete problem. Naturally, the stack sorting problem is not NP-complete 
since it can be solved in 2n-3 steps with the naive algorithm and (5n+5)/3 steps with the Gates algorithm. 
That's determining the minimal amount of steps that is NP.</p> 

<p>Further information can be found on the wikipedia page, as usual.</p>


<p>This activity is also integrated to CSIRL (my repository of <i>free</i> 
unplugged activities to introduce computer science, available at
http://www.loria.fr/~quinson/Mediation/SMN/), and it may be
interesting to run the unplugged activities before implementing these
algorithms in PLM.</p>


<h3>What can I do to improve this PLM universe?</h3>

<p>As usual, there are several things that could be done in the code of this universe to improve it:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A temporal view similar to the sorting universe could be helpful</li>
  <li>Other exercises, for example on the Roti sorting, with a pile of Roti that have to touch the grill 
      on each face (see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancake_sorting#The_identical_pancake_stack).</li>
</ul>
