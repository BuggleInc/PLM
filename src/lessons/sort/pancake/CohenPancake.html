<h1>Faster Burned Pancake Sorting</h1>

<p>The Gates' algorithm that we saw in the previous exercise quickly sort a stack of unburned pancakes 
by increasing the size of the blocks of sorted pancakes. This is much faster that the naive algorithm 
which moves at each step the largest pancake to the bottom of still unsorted pancakes. Gates' algorithm 
manages to sort a stack of <i>n</i> pancakes in less than <i>(5n + 5)/3</i> steps in the worst case, 
while the naive algorithm requires at most <i>2n</i> steps. Gates is thus about one third faster in the 
worst case.</p>

<p>In this exercise, we will explore an adaptation of the same idea to burnt pancakes. This was first 
published by David X. Cohen and Manuel Blum. David Cohen co-founded a few years later the Futurama TV 
show full of mathematical jokes. Definitively, interesting people studied that 
little pancake problem...</p>

<p>The Cohen's algorithm is slightly easier than the Gates' one since it distinguishes less cases:</p>

<p><b>Case 1:</b> At least one pancake is rightside up in the stack. Let <i>p</i> be the largest such pancake. 
 Note that <i>p + 1</i> must therefore be upside down, unless <i>p = n</i> (in which case there is no <i>p + 1</i> pancake).</p>

<ul>
  <li><b>Case 1.a:</b> <i>p+1</i> is lower in the stack than <i>p</i>.  <div align="center"><img src="img/cohen-1a.png"/></div><br/></li>
  <li><b>Case 1.b:</b> <i>p+1</i> is higher in the stack than <i>p</i>. <div align="center"><img src="img/cohen-1b.png"/></div><br/></li>
  <li><b>Case 1.c:</b> There is no <i>p+1</i> because <i>p</i> is the largest pancake in stack, that is because <i>p = n</i>.
     If pancake <i>p</i> is already in position, there is nothing to do. If not, you can move it to the bottom of the stack in 2 flips:
     <div align="center"><img src="img/cohen-1c.png"/></div>
     
    <b>The trick is that the pancake <i>p</i> should never be considered again.</b> Otherwise, you will consider that pancake 
      again and again since it's rightside up, and since that's the largest pancake. To leave that pancake alone, you should 
      keep track of the stack size that is still to be sorted. Any traversal of the stack must then only consider these pancakes,
      leaving alone the ones that are already in position at the bottom of the stack.
     </li>
</ul>
   
 
<p><b>Case 2:</b> All pancakes are downside. Again, we distinguish two sub-cases.</p>
  
<ul>
 <li><b>Case 2.a:</b> There is at least one <i>p</i> for which <i>p+1</i> is higher than <i>p</i> 
   (if there is several such <i>p</i>, take the largest one).
   <div align="center"><img src="img/cohen-2a.png"/></div><br/>
 </li>
 <li><b>Case 2.b:</b> Any pancake <i>p</i> is lower than pancake <i>p+1</i>. In that case, we must have that setting:
    <div align="center"><img src="img/cohen-2b.png"/></div>
 </li>
</ul>

<p>As you can see, we achieve one join in 2 flips in the cases 1 or 2.a. Since we need to achieve n joins to sort the stack, we can sort 
the stack in <i>2n</i> steps if case 2.b does not occurs.</p>

<p>That case 2.b requires a very different handling as it is obviously not possible to achieve a join in only 2 flips. 
  But fortunately, we can leverage the very specific setting of the stack in that case to provide the following algorithm. 
  It sorts a stack in that exact configuration after exactly <i>2n</i> steps.</p>
  
<pre>
Repeat n times
    Flip the whole stack of n pancakes
    Flip the top (n-1) pancakes
</pre>
 
<p>It may sound somehow magic, but it actually works, as depicted on an example below.</p>

<p><div align="center"><img src="img/cohen-2b-algo.png"/></div></p>

<p>So, all in all, the Cohen algorithm manages to sort the stack of burnt pancakes in <i>2n</i> steps in all cases. 
Quite a win over the naive algorithm for burnt pancakes that requires <i>3n</i> steps.</p>

Don't worry. This exercise is very difficult, so it's ok if it does not work right away for you.
Add some relevant logging to your code to understand where it stop performing correctly. 
Make sure to use the method <code>isSelected()</code> so that your logs only appears in the 
currently displayed world. In particular, it may help to print textually the state of the world
each time you enter the main loop.
