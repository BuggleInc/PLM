<h1>Faster Pancake Sorting</h1>

<p>Unlike others sorting problem, the expensive operation is not the comparison of values, but
the flipping of pancakes. In this exercise, we will explore another algorithm that 
attempt to reduce the amount of stack flipping. The funny side is that this algorithm was first 
introduced by Bill Gates, before invented Windows.</p>

<p>The basic idea is to grow sequences of sorted pancakes, not necessarily starting from the bottom. 
We say that a sequence of ordered pancakes constitute a <b>block</b> while a pancake that is not part
of a block is said to be <b>free</b>. The algorithm then considers the topmost pancake (of radius 
<code>t</code>) and search for the <code>t+1</code> or <code>t-1</code> pancakes (the considered 
neighbor is noted <code>t+o</code>). Eight cases may happen:</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Case a</b>: Both <code>t</code> and <code>t+o</code> are free. They are then merged in one flip.<br/>

</li></ul>

<ul><li><b>Case b</b>: <code>t</code> is free, and <code>t+o</code> is the first of a block. They are merged in one flip.<br/>
<div align="center"><img src="img/gates-b.png"/></div>
</li></ul>

<ul>
<li><b>Case c</b>: <code>t</code> is free but both <code>t-1</code> and <code>t+1</code> are the last elements of blocks. 
Both blocks and <code>t</code> are merged all together in 4 flips. 
Beware, if either <code>t-1</code> or <code>t+1</code> does not exist (because <code>t</code> is 0 or max), only two flips are mandated.

</li></ul>

<ul>
<li><b>Case d</b>: <code>t</code> is in a block but <code>t+o</code> is free. They are merged in one flip.<br/>
<div align="center"><img src="img/gates-d.png"/></div>
</li></ul>

<ul>
<li><b>Case e</b>: <code>t</code> is in a block and <code>t+o</code> is the first element of a block. They are merged in one flip.<br/>
<div align="center"><img src="img/gates-e.png"/></div>
</li></ul>

<ul><li><b>Case f</b>: <code>t</code> is in a block and <code>t+o</code> is the last element of another block. 
They are merged in 3 flips as follows.<br/>
<div align="center"><img src="img/gates-f.png"/></div></li></ul>

<ul><li><b>Case g</b>: <code>t</code> is in a block of length k+1 (the last element is <code>t+ko</code>), <code>t+(k+1)o</code> is either free or the last element of another block. Both blocks are merged in 2 flips:<br/>
<div align="center"><img src="img/gates-g.png"/></div><br/></li></ul>

<ul><li><b>Case h</b>: <code>t</code> is in a block of length k+1 (the last element is <code>t+ko</code>), 
  <code>t+(k+1)o</code> is the first element of another block (the difference with case g is that 
  <code>t+(k+1)o</code> is now the <i>first</i> element of its block). Both blocks are merged in 2 flips:<br/>
<div align="center"><img src="img/gates-h.png"/></div>
</li></ul>

<ul><li><b>Case i</b>: <code>t</code> is in a block of length <code>n</code> (this block contains all pancakes). 
If <code>t</code> is not 1, the whole stack is fliped. The algorithm then stops.</li></ul>    

<p>Each iteration increases the size of the blocks, so the algorithm eventually halts in all cases. A finer analysis would show that it takes 
at most <code>(5n+5)/3</code> steps to sort the stack. That's better than the naïve algorithm, that requires 2n-3 steps.</p>

<h2>Your turn</h2>
<p>You now have almost enough information to implement this algorithm on your own. We just have to remove the last remaining ambiguities 
to ensure that you implement exactly the same algorithm that the correction. If several cases apply to your situation, then you 
should use the first given one. For example, if both cases a and b apply (e.g., with <code>t-1</code> on case <b>a</b> and <code>t+1</code> 
on case <b>b</b>), then you should apply the flips of case <b>a</b>. If a given case applies for both <code>t+1</code> and <code>t-1</code>,
then you should apply it to <code>t+1</code>.</p>

<p>Note that it is somehow harder than the other exercises we did so far, so don't be surprised if you need more time to achieve this. 
But do not give up hope, you can do it!</p>

<p><div class="tip" id="tip-1" alt="Well, I need some help to start.">
First write some helper functions such as <code>isFirst()</code> or
<code>isFree()</code>. This will simplify your main algorithm
afterward, that can be written very similarly to the explication
above with a bunch of if conditions. Factorizing code this way often
helps making your code more readable.
</div></p>

<p><div class="tip" id="tip-2" alt="My code keeps failing and I don't know how to debug it.">
To debug one world after the other and avoid that the messages of all
worlds get intermixed, you can write your debug function only if the
method <code>isSelected()</code> returns true. It will be so only for
the entity that is currently selected in the graphical interface, that
is probably the world you are currently debugging. This will help breaking the
difficulty in parts by debugging the situation one after the other.<br/>
In particular, it may help to print textually the state of the world
each time you enter the main loop.
