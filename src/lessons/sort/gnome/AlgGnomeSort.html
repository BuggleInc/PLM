<h1>Miscellaneous sorting</h1>

<h2>GnomeSort</h2>

<p>The Gnome sort is similar to insertion sort, but the elements are moved in
position by a serie of swaps just like in bubble sort. It is named after the
supposed behavior of garden gnomes when they sort flower pots. Here is a
description of the algorithm by its author:</p>

<p>Gnome Sort is based on the technique used by the standard Dutch Garden Gnome
(Du.: tuinkabouter). Here is how a garden gnome sorts a line of flower
pots. Basically, he looks at the flower pot next to him and the previous
one; if they are in the right order he steps one pot forward, otherwise he
swaps them and steps one pot backwards. Boundary conditions: if there is no
previous pot, he steps forwards; if there is no pot next to him, he is
done.  <i>â€”Dick Grune</i></p>
