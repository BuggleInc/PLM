<h1>Sorting Algorithms</h1>

This lesson allows to experiment with some classical sorting algorithms (and
some less common variante of them). The goal is two fold: you can first
better understand the idea of these algorithms by writting them
yourself. But even if you don't code the algorithms, you can use the demo
mode to organize "races" between these algorithms to experiment in practice
what the different asymptotical complexity mean. 

<p>An exercise on recursive sorting algorithms (such as QuickSort and
MergeSort) is planned for the future.
