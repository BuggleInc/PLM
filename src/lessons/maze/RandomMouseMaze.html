<h2>The crazy mouse</h2>

<p>The day of your buggle starts badly. Out of luck, it got trapped into a
maze. Help it finding its path out of there. 
</p>

<p>
The exit is represented by a baggle and you need to 
pick this baggle in order to exit the maze.
</p>

<p>
Since the maze is so small, we can write the dumbest possible algorithm to
do so. It relies on randomness and proves quite inefficient.
</p>

<p>
While the buggle didn't find the path to the escape, it must proceed the
following way: pick a random integer between 0 and 2 by using the <code>random3()</code> method 
and make one of the following actions: moving forward if possible, turn left or turn right. 
</p>

<h3>Exercise goal</h3><a name="Objectives">

<p>
This exercise's objective is to write an algorithm
allowing the buggle to find its path out of the maze. Do not forget to let
your buggle pick up the baggle once it found the way out.
</p>

<p>
Write the <code>run()</code> method so that your buggle
takes a random decision (forward, turn left or turn right). You can use the
<code>random3()</code> method which returns randomly either 0, 1 or 2.
</p>

<p>
Don't forget to pick up the baggle once you've reached it.
</p>

<p>You're up.</p>
