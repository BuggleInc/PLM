<h2>Welcome to the PLM</h2>

<p>The goal of this first exercise is to instruct your buggle to move forward
by one step. Switch between the <i>World</i> view and the <i>Objective</i>
one for more details.</p>

<h3>My <i>buggle</i>? What is this??</h3>

<p>Buggles are little animals obeying any order you may give them. Currently,
you must use the [!thelang/] programming language for that, but you can
change the language from the menu, or by clicking the icon in the status
bar.</p>

<h3>How to proceed?</h3>
  
<p>Write the code to move your buggle by one step forward in the Code pane
(using the interactive controls is not enough). Your code should read as
follows:</p>
 <pre>[!java|scala|python]forward()[!java];[/!][/!][!c]stepForward();[/!]</pre>
[!java|c]<p>Non dimenticate il <code>;</code> finale che dirà al compilatore che
l'istruzione è finita (si, i computer sono tanto stupidi da non
<i>intuire</i> cose ovvie come questa).</p>[/!]
 
<p>Once done, click on Run to execute your code.</p>

<p>If your code contains errors, that's perfectly OK: Even talented programmers
sometimes struggle on their code.  The computer will display error messages
in the console to help you fixing them. The displayed messages may sound
scary at first glance, but don't panic. The compiler is only somehow limited
in its communication abilities, but it's not mean. If you look closer, the
solution to solve your issue is written somewhere in those cryptic
messages. You will see, with a bit of habit, we get used to it.</p>
