<h2>Writing more complex programs</h2>
  Now that we know how to draw things on the board, we'll enjoy this ability and 
  draw a beautiful G on the board (check Objective panel for details on what's 
  expected). 

  <p>When you write a quite complex program, it is sometimes useful to <b>add
   comments</b> to simplify the code reviews afterward. Here for example, it's 
   quite easy to get lost in the drawing process, and you may want to add 
   comments like <i>vertical bar done</i> or <i>finished drawing the G. Time to 
   move back to initial position</i>. Commenting your code is almost mandatory if you 
   (or someone else) want to read it afterward, although overcommenting 
   (describing obvious stuff) is a bad idea as the important idea get lost in the noise. 
   There is <if lang="Java">three</if><if lang="Python">two</if> types of comments in Java, instructing the compiler to not read the 
   text you add for humans:
  <ul>
    <li><b>Comments on a single line</b>. When the compiler encounters the symbol
<if lang="Java">//</if><if lang="Python">#</if>, it ignores the end of the line.</li>
    <li><b>Comments on several lines</b>. The compiler ignores anything placed
between the symbols <if lang="Java">/*</if><if lang="Python">''' at the begining of a
line</if> and <if lang="Java">*/</if><if lang="Python">''' at the end of a line</if>
<if lang="Java">, even if they are placed on differing lines</if>.</li>
  </ul>

  <p><if lang="Java">There is a third kind of comments, between /** and */, which are read by a
specific program called JavaDoc to generate automatically the documentation
explaining how to use the code. These comments must follow a very precise
formalism.</if><if lang="Python">The comments on several lines, could also be used for
documenting functions and classes.</if></p>
