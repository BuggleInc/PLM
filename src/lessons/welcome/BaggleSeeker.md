## Baggle Seeking ##

The buggle world can sometimes contain some *baggles* , which are little
biscuits that buggles can carry from one point to another. For that, they
have to use specific methods such as ` isOverBaggle(), isCarryingBaggle(),
pickUpBaggle()` or ` dropBaggle()` . Check their documentation in
"Help/About this world" for more details. 
### Exercise goal ###

Let each buggle find its baggle by adapting the code you wrote in previous exercise
(copy/paste what you've done before to save time).
