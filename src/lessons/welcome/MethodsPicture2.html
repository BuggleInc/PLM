<h2>Methodically drawing (only bigger)</h2>

We will now reproduce an even bigger geometrical drawing. Once again, you
can see the model by clicking on the "Objective" tab.

<p>You can naturally reuse all the code you typed in previous exercise (select
the other exercise, do Ctrl-C, come back to the code of this exercise, do
Ctrl-V).</p>

<p>But you want to keep your <code>run()</code> as simple as possible. For
that, define new methods to deal simply with the repetitions in the
pattern. For example, a method <code>makePattern()</code> achieving the
pattern of previous example seems to be a good idea (but this may not be
enough).</p> 
 
<p>Why don't you give it a shot? The <code>run()</code> method shouldn't take
more than 2 lines (included in a for loop)</p>

<p>To proceed to the next exercise, you need to remark that the combobox used 
to switch the exercise have a scroll bar that you can use to see the next 
exercises of the lesson.
