<h2>Buggle Dance Revolution 2</h2>
<h3>(BDR2)</h3>

BDR is cool, but it's a bit chaotic. First, the buggles giggle in any
directions, and then the code you had to write to let them move is rather
difficult to read. Here is a new BDR world where the buggle will dance a
gentle circle. We will benefit this tranquillity to clean up a bit our code
thanks to the new constructs we will introduce.

<h3><tt>switch</tt> conditionals</h3>

The hardest part of previous code is certainly the conditional
cascading. Somewhere in your code, you certainly had something similar to:

<pre>if (getIndication() == 'R') {
  turnRight();
  forward();
} else if (getIndication() == 'L') {
  turnLeft();
  forward();
} else if (getIndication() == 'U') {
  turnBack();
  forward();
/* other else if */
} else {
  return;
}
</pre>

When you review this code, it may not be clear at the first glance that it
is simply a choice with 4 branches depending on the value of
getIndication(). To improve this, we will use a <code>switch</code>
construct, which Java syntax is the following:

<pre>
switch (<b>expression</b>) {
  case <b>firstValue</b>: 
    <b>whatToDoIfExpressionEqualsFirstValue();</b>
    break;
  case <b>secondValue</b>: 
    <b>whatToDoIfExpressionEqualsSecondValue();</b>
    break;
  case <b>thirdValue</b>: 
    <b>whatToDoIfExpressionEqualsThirdValue();</b>
    break;
    /* as much similar cases as you want */
  default: 
    <b>whatToDoIfExpressionDoesNotEqualsAnySeenValues();</b>
}</pre>

Observe that each branch of a <tt>switch</tt> must be ended by a
<code>break</code>. If you forget this, the machine keeps going and execute
the next branch in the list after the branch it jumped to. There is even
some <b>rare</b> cases where this behavior reveals helpful.

<p>It is then possible to rewrite previous BDR code in a cleaner way using the
<tt>switch</tt> construct:</p>

<pre>switch (getIndication()) {
  case 'R':
    turnRight(); 
    forward(); 
    break;
  case 'L':
    turnLeft();
    forward(); 
    break;
  case 'U':
    turnBack();
    forward();
    break;
  default: 
    return;
}</pre>


<h2>Variables shared between methods</h2>

Another issue in your code is that it begins to be a bit long to be written
as a single method. We would like to split it up in two methods:
<ul>
 <li><code>danceOneStep()</code> would take care of achieving a single dance step</li>
 <li><code>run()</code> would take care of the dance as a whole. It would do the
steps while we didn't encounter a cell not asking any further move.</li>
</ul>

<p>The difficulty is to make sure that <tt>danceOneStep()</tt> keeps
<tt>run()</tt> informed that there is no further dance step to achieve. The
simpler solution is to have a boolean function visible from both methods
indicating whether there is more steps to do or if we're done. For that, we
have to write out the following of any method:
<pre>boolean moreMusic = true;</pre>

<p>Note that it is possible to write variable declarations out of any methods,
but that instructions must be in a method. In Java such <i>global</i>
variables are called <b>fields</b>.</p>

<p>Then, the <tt>danceOneStep()</tt> must be changed to update this variable to
<tt>false</tt> when there is nothing more to do. For that, simply add
<code>moreMusic = false;</code> before any <tt>return</tt>.

<p>It is then possible to use the following <tt>run()</tt> method:
<pre>public void run() {
  while (moreMusic)
    danseOneStep();
}</pre>

<h3>Exercise goal</h3><a name="Objective">Apply the improvement we just saw to rewrite your buggle
code. 

<p>You don't have to write the <tt>run()</tt> method since the buggle already
know it. If you put it anyway, the compiler will complain about this
multiple definition without noticing that both declarations match. Simply
declare the variable <tt>moreMusic</tt> and the <tt>danceOneStep()</tt>
method.</p>

<p>Here are the ground indications to use for BRD2. Note that we can now move a
bugle up to 6 cells in one dance step.

<table border="1">
 <tr><td>Message</td>
     <td>What to do</td></tr>

 <tr><td>R</td><td>Turn right and move one step forward</td></tr>
 <tr><td>L</td><td>Turn left and move one step forward</td></tr>
 <tr><td>I</td><td>Turn back and move one step forward</td></tr>

 <tr><td>A</td><td>Move one step forward</td></tr>
 <tr><td>B</td><td>Move two steps forward</td></tr>
 <tr><td>C</td><td>Move three steps forward</td></tr>
 <tr><td>D</td><td>Move four cells forward</td></tr>
 <tr><td>E</td><td>Move five cells forward</td></tr>
 <tr><td>F</td><td>Move six cells forward</td></tr>

 <tr><td>Z</td><td>Move one step backward</td></tr>
 <tr><td>Y</td><td>Move two steps backward</td></tr>
 <tr><td>X</td><td>Move three steps backward</td></tr>
 <tr><td>W</td><td>Move four cells backward</td></tr>
 <tr><td>V</td><td>Move five cells backward</td></tr>
 <tr><td>U</td><td>Move six cells backward</td></tr>
</table>

<p>In any other case, you should stop</p>

<p>When you program works again, proceed to next exercise.</p>
