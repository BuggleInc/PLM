<h2>While loops</h2>
		
<p>In addition to conditionals, another handy construction is the ability to
repeat an action while a specific condition does not appear. A while loop is
used for that, with the following syntax:
 <pre class="Java">while (<b>condition</b>) {
&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>action()</b>;
}</pre>
 <pre class="Python">while <b>condition</b>:
&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>action()</b></pre>

<p>Naturally, if the chosen action does not modify the value of the condition,
the buggle will do the action endlessly. The <b>stop</b> button of the
interface becomes then handy. To test this, you can try to type the
following code in the editor:

 <pre class="Java">while (true) {
&nbsp;&nbsp;turnLeft();
}</pre>
 <pre class="Python">while True:
&nbsp;&nbsp;turnLeft()</pre>

The buggle will turn left while true is true (ie, endlessly),
or until you stop it manually using the stop button.</p>

<h3>Exercise goal</h3><a name="Objective">You now have to write some code so that your buggles
move forward until they encounter a wall. The idea is thus to do something
like:
<pre>while we are not facing a wall, do:
&nbsp;&nbsp;moveForward()</pre>

<p>When your program works, move forward to the next exercise.</p>
