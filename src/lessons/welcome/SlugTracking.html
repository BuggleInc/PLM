<h2>Slug Tracking</h2>

After all this excitation of slug hunting, we will have to learn hot to track
their trail. Your buggle just happened to found the trail of
a slug: a green dribbling tracks. If it manage to follow it to its end, it
will find a baggle representing an appetizing slug (from a buggle point of
view). 

<p>To reach that goal, you had to write the previously given boolean method
<tt>isFacingTrail</tt>, which should determine whether we are facing a
green cell or not. Of course, if we are facing a wall, it should return
false. It would be great if this method could have no <b>side effect</b>.
on the calling buggle and on the world.</p>

<p>Remember that this method takes the color of the trail we want to
follow as an argument. Slugs leave green trails, but other prey leave trails
of other colors. In Java, there is a <i>data type</i> <tt>Color</tt> to
indicate the colors. The green color is defined by <code>Color.green</code>.</p>

<h3>Exercise goal</h3><a name="Objectives">Complete the <code>isFacingTrail()</code> method (which gets
called by <code>hunt()</code> automatically). You don't have to write the
<code>hunt()</code> method.
