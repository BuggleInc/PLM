<h2>Instructions</h2>

Congratulations! You just wrote your first program! You got the idea now: 
programming is nothing more than giving simple instructions to the computer that 
blindly apply them. The main difficulty is to explain stuff to something as stupid 
as a computer...  
  
  <p>Programs are mainly suites of method calls, which are no more than a list of
   simple orders given to the machine. It is very similar to a recipe stating
   <i>Melt the chocolate pieces, add sugar, cool the mix and serve</i>. 
   In your programs, such built instructions are called functions or methods, and you 
   should add parenthesis to invoke them:</p>  
		<pre><code class="code-container">nameOfTheMethod()</code></pre>
		
   <p>[!thelang] wants to have the instructions separated by semi-columns 
    (;)[!python|scala] or by new lines[/!].
    The previous example would thus be written in the following 
    way[!python|scala] (you can also add semi-columns at the end of the lines, but this is not mandatory)[/!].</p>
    
<pre><code class="code-container">meltTheChocolatePieces()[!java|c];[/!]
addSugar()[!java|c];[/!]
coolMix()[!java|c];[/!]
serve()[!java|c];[/!]
</code></pre>
    
[!python|scala]
   <p>It could also be written in the following way, but it's generally considered as a bad 
   practice to group several instructions on the same line since it greatly hinders the 
   readability.</p>
<pre><code class="code-container">
meltTheChocolatePieces(); addSugar(); coolMix(); serve()
</code></pre>
[/!]

  <p>Of course, these specific methods do not exist by default in [!thelang],
  but it may be possible to define them by yourself (we'll see later how to 
  define your how methods).</p>
  
  <p>For now, 
  we'll simply go for the buggle instructions. There is a method for each button of the 
  interactive control panel. To achieve the same effect than the <b>forward</b> button 
  (making the buggle moving one step forward), you need to write the following in the
  editor: </p>
<pre><code class="code-container">[!java|scala|python]forward()[!java];[/!][/!][!c]stepForward();[/!]</code></pre>
  <p>Likewise, to achieve the same effect than the <b>[!java|scala|python]backward[/!][!c]stepBackward[/!]</b>, <b>left</b>
  and <b>right</b> buttons, you need to use respectively:</p>
<pre><code class="code-container">backward()[!java|c];[/!]
left()[!java|c];[/!]
right()[!java|c];[/!]
</code></pre>

	 <p>The <b>mark</b> button is a bit particular, since it correspond to two
methods: the first one moves the pen up while the second moves it down.</p>
<pre><code class="code-container">brushUp()[!java|c];[/!]
brushDown()[!java|c];[/!]
</code></pre>
  <p>The buggle offers other methods, that are presented from the "Help/about
   this world" menu and will be introduced on need.</p>


  <h3>Exercise goal</h3><a name="Objectives"/>
  Our second program will be a bit more complicated, but not much. The goal for 
  your buggle is simply to draw a house (a box), and hide inside. Check the 
  objective world to see exactly what this means. 

  <p>Use your brush to mark the ground as you walk. Start marking the ground with 
  <code>brushDown()</code>, and stop it with <code>brushUp()</code> afterward 
  (e.g., to enter your house without marking its ground). The full list of all 
  instructions understood by your buggle can be found by clicking on the button <i>API</i> of the <i>Code editor</i> section.</p>
