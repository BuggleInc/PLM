<h2>Instructions</h2>

Congratulations! You just wrote your first program! You got the idea
now: programming is nothing more than giving simple instructions to
the computer that blindly apply them. The main difficulty is to
explain stuff to something as stupid as a computer...

<p>Our second program will be a bit more complicated, but not
  much. The goal for your buggle is simply to draw a house (a box),
  and hide inside. Check the objective world to see exactly what this
  means.</p>

<p>For that, you will need <code>forward()</code>, <code>left()</code>
  and <code>right()</code>. Use your brush to mark the ground as you
  walk. Start marking the ground with <code>brushDown()</code>, and
  stop it with <code>brushUp()</code> afterward (e.g., to enter your
  house without marking its ground).</p>

<h3>What exactly is a program?</h3>

<p>Programs are mainly suites of method calls, which are no more than
  a list of simple orders given to the machine. It is very similar to
  a recipe stating <i>Melt the chocolate pieces, add sugar, cool the
  mix and serve</i>.  [!thelang] wants to have the instructions
  separated by semi-columns (;)[!python|scala] or by new lines[/!],
  and followed by parenthesis. Our little receipe would thus be
  written in the following way[!python|scala] (you can also add
  semi-columns at the end of the lines, but this is not
  mandatory)[/!].</p>
    
<pre>
meltTheChocolatePieces()[!java|c];[/!]
addSugar()[!java|c];[/!]
coolMix()[!java|c];[/!]
serve()[!java|c];[/!]
</pre>
    
<p>Do not write it all on one line only even if the computer would
  accept it [!python|scala](provided that you don't omit the
  semi-columns)[/!]. This is a <b>really bad idea</b>, hindering the
  readability.  <i>Programs must be written for people to read, and
  only incidentally for machines to execute,</i> as said Harold
  Abelson.</p>

<p>There is a limited set of instructions that buggles understand, and
  we will eventually learn how to define new ones. For now, there is a
  method for each button of the interactive control panel. To achieve
  the same effect than the <b>forward</b> button (making the buggle
  moving one step forward), you need to write the following in the
  editor: </p>

<pre>[!java|scala|python]forward()[!java];[/!][/!][!c]stepForward();[/!]</pre>
<p>Likewise, to achieve the same effect than
  the <b>[!java|scala|python]backward[/!][!c]stepBackward[/!]</b>, <b>left</b>
  and <b>right</b> buttons, you need to use respectively:</p>
<pre>
backward()[!java|c];[/!]
left()[!java|c];[/!]
right()[!java|c];[/!]
</pre>

<p>The <b>mark</b> button is a bit particular, since it correspond to
  two methods: the first one moves the pen up while the second moves
  it down.</p>
<pre>
brushUp()[!java|c];[/!]
brushDown()[!java|c];[/!]
</pre>

<p>The buggle offers other methods, that are presented from the
   "Help/about this world" menu and will be introduced on need.</p>
