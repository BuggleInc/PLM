<h1>Boolean fun</h1>

<p>Boolean operations are one of the very basic task in programming.
   As long as you cannot write a not so simple boolean test under the
   minute, you probably will have a very bad time writing a real
   program.</p>
   
<p>That is why this lesson provides you a bunch of such exercises, so
   that you can get trained in this.</p>

<p>This exercise was converted to PLM from the excellent exercising site http://codingbat.com/</p>
