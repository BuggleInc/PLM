<h1>Average value</h1>


<p>The objective of this exercise is to compute the average value of the integer values stored in an array.</p>

<p>You have to fill the body of the method <code>average(int[] tab)</code> which takes as parameter the array of integers of which it computes and returns the average value. Please note that the return type of the method has type <code>int</code>.</p>

<p>To compute the average value of an integer, it is necessary to traverse the whole array and to compute the sum of all its values (so you will need a variable to store this temporary result), then you have to divide this sum by the size of the array. In Java, you can get the size of an array <code>myarray</code> by consulting its <code>length</code> attribute (in other words, <code>myarray.length</code>).</p>
