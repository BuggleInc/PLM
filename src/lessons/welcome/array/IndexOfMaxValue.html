<h1>Index of the maximum value</h1>

<p>In this exercise, you must compute the indice of the tab cell containing the biggest value.</p>

<p>For that, fill the <code>indexOfMaximum(int[] tab)</code> method. Its parameter is the array to 
explore. Should the array contain the searched value 
several times, you should return the indice of the first occurrence.</p>  

<p>To solve this exercise, you should sweep over the whole array. For each value, if it's bigger 
than the biggest value you saw so far,  you must save this new champion and its position. 
You will thus need 2 extra variables; the initial value of the champion could be the value of the first cell.</p>
