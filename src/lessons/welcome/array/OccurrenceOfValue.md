# Occurrence of a value #

In this exercise, you must compute the amount of occurrences of a given value in an array
(that is, the amount of time that this value appears in the array). For that, fill the ` occurrences(int[] tab, int lookingFor)` method, which returns the number of
occurrence of ` lookingFor` in ` tab` .

To compute this value, simply sweep over the array counting for the amount of
cells containing the searched value. You thus need an extra variable for that.
