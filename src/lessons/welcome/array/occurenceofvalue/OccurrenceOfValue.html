<h1>Occurrence of a value</h1>

<p>In this exercise, you must compute the amount of occurrences of a given value in an array 
(that is, the amount of time that this value appears in the array). For that, fill the 
<code>occurrences(int[] tab, int lookingFor)</code> method, which returns the number of 
occurrence of <code>lookingFor</code> in <code>tab</code>.</p>

<p>To compute this value, simply sweep over the array counting for the amount of 
cells containing the searched value. You thus need an extra variable for that.</p>
