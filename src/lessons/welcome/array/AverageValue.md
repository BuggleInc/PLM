# Average value #

The objective of this exercise is to compute the average value of the integer values stored in an array.

You have to fill the body of the method which takes as parameter the array of integers of which it computes and returns the average value. Please note that the return type of the method has type .

To compute the average value of an integer, it is necessary to traverse the whole array and to compute the sum of all its values (so you will need a variable to store this temporary result), then you have to divide this sum by the size of the array. In Java, you can get the size of an array by consulting its attribute (in other words, ).
