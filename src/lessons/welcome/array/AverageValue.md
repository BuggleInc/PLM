# Average value #

The objective of this exercise is to compute the average value of the integer values stored in an array.

You have to fill the body of the method ` average(int[] tab)` which takes as parameter the array of integers of which it computes and returns the average value. Please note that the return type of the method has type ` int` .

To compute the average value of an integer, it is necessary to traverse the whole array and to compute the sum of all its values (so you will need a variable to store this temporary result), then you have to divide this sum by the size of the array. In Java, you can get the size of an array ` myarray` by consulting its ` length` attribute (in other words, ` myarray.length` ).
