<h2>Langton's ant</h2>

<p>In this exercise, you will turn your buggle into a <i>Langton's ant</i>. These 
artificial little animals are very interesting because they are given simple 
rules that depend only on their local environment, and after a period of 
apparent chaotic behavior, a general pattern <i>emerges</i>.</p>

<p>The rules are absolutely trivial: to compute what the next step should be, 
you should check the current color of the ground (using 
<code>getGroundColor()</code>). If it's white, change it to black, turn right 
and move forward by one cell. If the ground is currently black, change it to 
white, turn left and move forward by one cell.</p> 

<p>It's hard to come up with simpler rules isn't it? Well, let's go and code it 
now. You have to complete the <code>step()</code> method, which encodes the 
behavior of the ant at each step. You will probably use the <code>getGroundColor()</code> 
method to retrieve the color of the cell on which the ant is currently. To 
compare colors, you cannot use the equal sign (=), because these things are not 
scalar values but objects. Instead, you need to write something like the following:
</p> 
<pre>
Color c /* = some initialization */;
if (c.equals(Color.black)) {
  /* that's equal */
} else {
  /* that was not equal */
}
</pre>

<p>Changing the ground color is not difficult, but a bit long: you have to 
change the brush color of your buggle, set the brush down (to mark the current 
cell -- with <code>brushDown()</code>), and set the brush back up (with 
<code>brushUp()</code>) to avoid further issues when the buggle will 
move. You are naturally free of organizing your code the way you want, but you may
want to write a <code>void setGroundColor(Color c)</code> method to factorize 
things a bit.</p>

<h2>More information on Langton's ant</h2>

<p>As you can see from the execution of this exercise, the interest in this algorithm 
is that after about 10000 steps of relative chaotic behavior, the ant start building 
a regular pattern. This emergence of a regular pattern from the chaos is rather 
fascinating, isn't it?</p>   

<p>This mechanism were invented in 1986 by Chris Langton, and later generalized 
in several ways (as we shall see in the next exercises). It was proven in 2000 that 
the ant's trajectory can be used to compute any boolean circuit, and thus that the 
ant is capable of universal computation (ie, any possible computation can be achieved 
using the ant as a computing device). Yet another subject of fascination...</p>
