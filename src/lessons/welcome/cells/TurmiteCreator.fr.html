<h2>Creating Turmites</h2>

<p>This exercise allows you to build your own turmites. To pass the exercise,
you should simply write a <code>init()</code> method which initializes the
<code>rule</code> to use the following transitions table (from wikipedia),
set the buggle initial position at (8;33), and ask for 8342 steps.</p> 

<table border="1" style="text-align:center">
<tr>
<th rowspan="3" colspan="2"></th>
<th colspan="6">Current color</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<th colspan="3">0</th>
<th colspan="3">1</th>

</tr>
<tr style="font-size:9pt">
<th>Couleur à écrire</th>
<th>Virage</th>

<p>Où les virages à effectuer sont
<b>L</b> (90° vers la gauche -- left),
<b>R</b> (90° vers la droite -- right),
<b>N</b> (rien -- no turn),
<b>U</b> (demi tour de 180° -- U-turn).
</p>

<h2>Going further</h2>
<p>This exercise is naturally an excuse to let you experiment with your own
turmites.  Feel free to change the transition table and the amount of steps
to experiment by yourself. To that extend, you may find the Ed Pegg Jr's
library useful. If you find new interesting patterns, send them per email so
that we can integrate them to this list!  </p>

<p>In addition, wikipedia is desperately missing some good looking colorful
turmites: only black and white ones are depicted.  You should consider
submitting your creations directly to the free encyclopedia.</p>

<p>Langton's ants may not share the expressiveeness power of the turmites, but
they remain fascinating too. You can experiment with them using the
initLangton() method, provided in your template, that allows to build a
Turmite transition table from a Langton's ant name. Tiny changes in the ant
may result huge changes. For example, "RRL" does not seam to lead to any
constructed pattern, even after a million steps, but "RLL" starts building a
very simple highway pattern after less than 100 steps!</p>  

<p>Quite a lot of Langton's ants build highways: RL, of course, but also
RLRLRLLRLR (about 2500 steps).  The chaotic behavior of ants before the
highway can be very short (as with RLL that only need 100 steps to converge)
or very long, as with LLLLLLRRLRRR which seems chaotic for more than 500,000
steps before build the highway or even RRLLLRRRLRRR which needs 1170000 to
start converging. Some are narrow, and others are very large, such as
RRLRLLRLRR (200,000 steps). This ant is also notable since it is somehow
squarish even before the highway start where most others do not show
anything notable before their highway.<p>

<p>Some ants fill solid sectors, such as RRLLLRLLLRRR (16,000 steps),
RRLLLRLLLRRR (30,000 steps), RRLLLRRRRRLR (125,000 steps) or RRLRLLRRRRRR
(20,000 steps). Some even fill the whole space (RRLRR after 3000
steps). Some of my personal favorite ones are the ones where the ant seem to
be bouncing within a box that gets bigger on each bump, such as LRRRRRLLR
(30,000 steps). LRRRRLLLRRR is even more impressing since the bounces within
the box are regular and since it converges more rapidly to its stable
behavior (15,000 steps are enough).</p>

<p>Finally, some ants are just build artistic patterns. You should check this
video for some beautiful ones:
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X-gtr4pEBU. If you want to convert them into
your code, you have to shift them by one: For example, the one depicted at
3:42 is not RRLRLRLLRL, but RLRLRLLRLR (the first visible move should be
read as last one).</p>

<p>As you can see by exploring the above set of turmites, they are usually not
as colorful as the ants, but this may be because very few colors suffice to
exhibit complex behaviors. For example, there is a specific class of
turmites called <i>busy beavers</i> which are turmites that write a lot of
things before stopping (busy beavers are usually classical turing machines,
but the idea fits perfectly to turmites too). There is a sort of
international competition where people strive to find the turmite that
covers the biggest area before stopping. The web page is here:
