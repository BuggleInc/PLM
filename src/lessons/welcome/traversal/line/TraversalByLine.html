<h2>Traversal by line</h2>

You once again have to let the buggle traverse the world numbering the cells
on its way, but the goal of this exercise is to write a line traversal. Most
of the code you wrote for previous exercise remains usable here. Simply, the
method computing the coordinates of the next buggle position has to be
correctly updated: if you are at the right of a line, you have to go to the
begining of the next one. If not, you have to go to the right cell.

<p>Your turn...</p>
