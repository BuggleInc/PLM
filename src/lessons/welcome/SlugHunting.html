<h2>Slug Hunting</h2>

After all this excitation of dance revolution, we will move on to a slower
activity : the slug hunting. Your buggle just happened to found the trail of
a slug: a green dribbling tracks. If it manage to follow it to its end, it
will find a baggle representing an appetizing slug (from a buggle point of
view). 

<p>To reach that goal, you have a boolean method
<tt>isFacingTrail</tt>, which determine whether we are facing a
green cell or not. Of course, if we are facing a wall, it returns
false.In addition, this method preserve the state
of the calling buggle and of the world. Such a method is said to have no
<b>side effect</b>.</p>

<p>It takes the color of the trail we want to
follow as an argument. Slugs leave green trails, but other prey leave trails
of other colors. In Java, there is a <i>data type</i> <tt>Color</tt> to
indicate the colors. The green color is defined by <code>Color.green</code>.</p>
	
<p>In order to hunt your prey, you should not mistake the part of the tracks to follow with the one your
buggle comes from, you should ask your buggle to leave a tracks behind
it. Don't forget to use the <code>brushDown()</code>  method to put your
brush down and <code>brushUp()</code> to move it up again.</p>

<p>A buggle can know the color of the cell it is over using the <code>Color
getGroundColor()</code> method.</p>

<p>Finally, do not forget to capture your prey once you found it (using
<code>pickUpBaggle()</code>).</p>


<h3>Exercise goal</h3><a name="Objectives">Complete the <code>hunt()</code> method (which gets
called by <code>run()</code> automatically). You should use the
<code>isFacingTrail()</code> method that is provided.
