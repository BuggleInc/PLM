<h1>AlarmClock</h1>
Given a day
of the week encoded as 0=Sun, 1=Mon, 2=Tue, ...6=Sat, and a boolean
indicating if we are on vacation, return a string of the form "7:00"
indicating when the alarm clock should ring. Weekdays, the alarm should
be "7:00" and on the weekend it should be "10:00". Unless we are on
vacation -- then on weekdays it should be "10:00" and weekends it
should be "off".
