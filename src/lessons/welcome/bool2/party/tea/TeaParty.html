<h1>TeaParty</h1>
We are having
a party with amounts of tea and candy. Return the int outcome of the
party encoded as 0=bad, 1=good, or 2=great. A party is good (1) if both
tea and candy are at least 5. However, if either tea or candy is at
least double the amount of the other one, the party is great (2).
However, in all cases, if either tea or candy is less than 5, the party
is always bad (0).
