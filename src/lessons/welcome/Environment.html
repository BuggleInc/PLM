  <h2>Welcome in the Buggles' World</h2>

  You just started the Java Learning Machine. This is a Learning Management
System (LMS) aiming at teaching the art of computer programming through interactive
exercises. It is constituted by a set of exercises grouped by lessons, allowing you 
to practice at your own pace. By default, the environment is configured to be programmed 
in the Java programming language, but you can change it from the Language menu if you want.

<p>In this first lesson, the buggles will lead your first steps in programming.

  <h3>The <i>buggles</i>? What is this??</h3>

  The buggles are little animals obeying any order you may give them. In each
  exercise, you have to provide them with the right instructions so that the
  world turns into the objective of the exercise. For example in this exercise, 
  you show instruct your buggle to move forward once. You can see that by checking 
  the difference between the <i>World</i> view and the <i>Objective</i> one. 
  Depending on the lessons (and your settings in the Language menu), your code must 
  be written in either Java, JavaScript, Python or Ruby.
  
  <h3>Working environment</h3>

  Before going any further, get familiar with the working environment. Have a 
  look at the several elements composing the main window, move your mouse over 
  them to show the tooltip, and experiment with the elements to see what they do.
  The white area below is the console: this is where errors and messages get 
  displayed. If you have access to the net, try to open the forum in the help 
  menu to check if other people are connected right now. Note that when you 
  successfully solve an exercise, the good news is spread on twitter. 
  Keep posted to the progress of your friends by following #jlmlovers :)  

  <p>If your code contains errors (and code always do at some point), the 
   computer will display error messages in the console. You obviously have to 
   fix the errors to pass the exercises. The messages that get displayed may 
   sound scary at first glance, but don't panic. The compiler is only somehow 
   limited in its communication abilities, but he's not mean. If you look closer, 
   the solution to solve your issue is written in the middle of those cryptic
   messages. You'll see, with a bit of habit, we get used to it.
  
  <h3>What am I supposed to do?</h3>
  
  <p>It's time to write your first program. Simply ask your buggle to move one step 
  forward using the Source Code pane. For that, simply write the following code
  (clicking on the interactive controls is not enough: You have to write the code 
  after experimenting interactively).
   <pre class="Java">forward();</pre>
   <pre class="Python">forward();</pre>
  <p class="Java">Do not forget the final <code>;</code> which tells the compiler that the
  instruction is over (yes, computers are so dumb that they cannot <i>guess</i> 
  obvious stuff like this).</p>
  
  <p>Once done, clic on run, and proceed to next exercise with the right combo-box 
   (or keep around to experiment further if you feel so).
