## Drawing bigger and bigger ##
As you can imagine, you have to reproduce the geometric drawing depicted in
the "Objectives" tab. As you can see, it is even bigger than the previous
one.

You thus have to declare even more methods to use the repetitions of the
pattern and factorize your code. Another solution is to your functions to reuse the code you wrote previously by changing the size.

Your turn...
