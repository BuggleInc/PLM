## Even more pattern to draw ##
### (and methods to write) ###
Here is yet another exercise where you have to reproduce the pattern
provided in the "Objective" tab.

This one is a bit more difficult than the one seen previously. Look for
repeating patterns, even if the color changes, and write a method drawing
each of them.

Good luck!
