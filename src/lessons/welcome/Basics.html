  <h2>Instructions</h2>

  Congratulations! You just wrote your first program! You got the idea now: 
  programming is nothing more than giving simple instructions to the computer that 
  blindly apply them. The main difficulty is to explain stuff to someone as stupid 
  as a computer...  
  
  <p>Programs are mainly suites of method calls, which are no more than a list of
   simple order given to the machine. It is very similar to a recipe stating
   <i>Melt the chocolate pieces, add sugar, cool the mix and serve</i>. 
   In your programs, such built instructions are called functions or methods, and you 
   should add parenthesis to invoke them, as in  
		<pre>nameOfTheMethod()</pre>
		
   <p class="Java">
   Java want to have the instructions separated by semi-columns (;). 
    The previous example would thus be written in a similar way:</p>
<pre class="Java">
meltTheChocolatePieces();
addSugar();
coolMix();
serve();
</pre>
    
   <p class="Python">Python want to have the instructions  
   separated by either semi-columns (;) or by new lines. The previous example would thus 
   be written the following way.</p>
<pre class="Python">
meltTheChocolatePieces()
addSugar()
coolMix()
serve()
</pre>
   <p class="Python">
   It could also be written in the following way, but it's generally considered as a bad 
   practice to group several instructions on the same line since it greatly hinders the 
   readability.</p>
<pre class="Python">
meltTheChocolatePieces(); addSugar(); coolMix(); serve()
</pre>

  <p class="Java">Of course, these specific methods do not exist in Java, but it may be possible 
  to define them by yourself (we'll see later how to define your how methods).</p>
  <p class="Python">Of course, these specific methods do not exist in Python, but it may be possible 
  to define them by yourself (we'll see later how to define your how methods).</p>
  <p>For now, 
  we'll simply go for the buggle instructions. There is a method for each button of the 
  interactive control panel. To achieve the same effect than the <b>forward</b> button 
  (making the buggle moving one step forward), you need to write the following in the
  editor: <pre class="Java">forward();</pre> <pre class="Python">forward()</pre>
  Likewise, to achieve the same effect than the <b>backward</b>, <b>turn
  left</b> and <b>turn right</b> buttons, you need to use respectively: 
<pre class="Java">
backward();
turnLeft();
turnRight();
</pre>
<pre class="Python">
backward()
turnLeft()
turnRight()
</pre>
	 The <b>mark</b> button is a bit particular, since it correspond to two
methods: the first one moves the pen up while the second moves it down.
<pre class="Java">
brushDown();
brushUp();
</pre>
<pre class="Python">
brushDown()
brushUp()
</pre>
  <p>The buggle offers other methods, that are presented from the "Help/about
   this world" menu and will be introduced on need.</p>


  <h3>Exercise goal</h3><a name="Objectives">
  Our second program will be a bit more complicated, but not much. The goal for 
  your buggle is simply to draw a house (a box), and hide inside. Check the 
  objective world to see exactly what this means.
