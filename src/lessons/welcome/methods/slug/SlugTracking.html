<h2>Slug Tracking</h2>
<p>
Your buggle is super happy! It just found the green dribbling trail, certainly left by a big yummy slug. 
At its end, the buggle is certain to entertain itself with this appetizing slug (represented as a baggle). 
</p>

<p>To reach that goal, you had to write a boolean method <tt>isFacingTrail</tt>, which determines whether 
we are facing a green cell or not. Of course, if we are facing a wall, it should return
false without bumping into it. You should make sure that this method has no <b>side effect</b>, i.e. that
it does not change the state of the calling buggle nor of its world.</p>

<p>Your tool to that end is the <code>getGroundColor()</code> that returns the color of
the current cell. Just go to the cell you want to test and run that function. 
[!java]You cannot test whether this color is equal to <code>Color.green</code> with an
<code>==</code> sign but instead you have to write something like
<code>getGroundColor().equals(Color.green)</code>. This is because green is an 
<i>object</i> in Java, and <code>.equals()</code> is the way to go to test equality between Java objects.[/!]</p>   

<h3>Exercise goal</h3>
<p>Complete the <code>isFacingTrail()</code> method (which gets called automatically).</p>
