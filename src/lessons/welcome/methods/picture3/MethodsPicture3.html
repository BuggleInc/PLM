<h2>Drawing bigger and bigger</h2>

As you can imagine, you have to reproduce the geometric drawing depicted in
the "Objectives" tab. As you can see, it is even bigger than the previous
one.

<p>You thus have to declare even more methods to use the repetitions of the
pattern and factorize your code. Another solution is to <i>parametrize</i>
your functions to reuse the code you wrote previously by changing the size.  

<p>Your turn...</p>
