<h2>Building methodically</h2>

We now would like to learn the buggle to build a doghouse. The seamingly
simpler approach consists in directly writing the needed code as follows (it
works because the buggle of this exercise leaves a red path as it moves).

<pre class="Java">
forward();
forward();
turnLeft(); 
forward();
forward();
turnLeft(); 
forward();
forward();
turnLeft(); 
forward();
forward();
turnLeft(); 
</pre>

<pre class="Python">
forward()
forward()
turnLeft() 
forward()
forward()
turnLeft() 
forward()
forward()
turnLeft() 
forward()
forward()
turnLeft() 
</pre>

<p>It becomes harder when we want to draw two doghouses: we have to rewrite the
same code twice, which is not really handy. Even worse: it's definitively
not good form to duplicate code this way. Indeed, if you realize that an
error sneaked into a code that you copied at several locations, you will
have to fix it several times. And mind your back if you forget one of these
locations.</p> 

<p>It is good form to <b>factorize your code</b>, ie to write it only once, for
example in a method. This is what you will do now. It is even possible to go
further by factorizing the method body with a <code>for</code> loop, as seen
previously.

<h3>Exercise goal</h3>The goal of this exercise is to write a method called <code>dogHouse</code>
achieving the same result than the code above. The buggle will call your
creation to create several dog houses around its world. Remind to factorize
your method with a for loop.

<p>You're up.</p>
