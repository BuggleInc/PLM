<h2>Flower Display Case</h2>

<p>Whao! That's not a little pot anymore! That's a huge large flower display case!
Your buggle can't help but starts flowering this gorgeous place. You should help 
it to prevent that it bumps into a wall...</p>

<p>PS: the newly used color is <code>Color.BLUE</code>.</p>
