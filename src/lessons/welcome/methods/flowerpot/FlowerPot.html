<h2>Flower Pot</h2>

<p>Your buggle decided to flower a bit the pot it lives in. You have to help it
reproducing the drawing of its dreams (check the "Objective" tab to see it).</p>

<p>For that, you have to write a <code>growFlowers()</code> method that does not 
take any parameter and does not return any result. You could probably make it without 
defining this method, but this is part of the assignment.</p>

<p>Also, you should try to decompose this complex drawing in sub-steps so that your code 
remains short and easy to read. A method to draw one flower of the color passed in 
parameter sounds like a good start, but it is probably not enough.</p>

<p>For your information, this drawing uses five colors that are listed below. 
[!java|scala|c]The data type of these constants is <code>Color</code>, that naturally 
describes a particular color.[/!]</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>[!scala|java|python]Color.[/!]RED</code></li>
  <li><code>[!scala|java|python]Color.[/!]PINK</code></li>
  <li><code>[!scala|java|python]Color.[/!]CYAN</code></li>
  <li><code>[!scala|java|python]Color.[/!]ORANGE</code></li>
  <li><code>[!scala|java|python]Color.[/!]GREEN</code></li>
  <li><code>[!scala|java|python]Color.[/!]YELLOW</code></li>
</ul>
