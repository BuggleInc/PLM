<h2>Methodically drawing in color (only bigger)</h2>

We will now reproduce an even bigger geometrical drawing. Once again, you
can see the model by clicking on the "Objective" tab.

<p>You can naturally reuse all the code you typed in previous exercise (select
the other exercise, do Ctrl-C, come back to the code of this exercise, do
Ctrl-V).</p>

<p class="Java">But you want to keep your main<code>run()</code> as simple as possible. For
that, define new methods to deal simply with the repetitions in the
pattern. For example, a method <code>makePattern()</code> achieving the
pattern of previous example seems to be a good idea (but this may not be
enough).</p>

<p class="Java">Why don't you give it a shot? The <code>run()</code> method shouldn't take
more than 2 lines (included in a for loop)</p>
