<h2>Methodically drawing</h2>

In this exercise, we will reproduce the geometric drawing that you can see
in the "Objective" tab.

<p>Your goal (here and in any well written program) is to write the simplest
possible code. For that, you have to decompose your work in
sub-steps, and write a specific method for each sub-step.</p>

<p>If you observe carefully the picture to draw, it is constituted of four
parts depicting a sort of V. A possible decomposition is to write a method 
in charge of drawing a V from the current position. Its prototype can be: 
<code>[!java|c]void [/!]makeV()</code></p>

<p>In this method, you should use the methods <code>brushUp()</code> and
<code>brushDown()</code> to mark the ground (you may want to factorize this in another
method). It may be wise to write the <code>makeV()</code> so that it places directly 
the buggle in position for the next V.</p>
 
<p>Your turn. Your code should not be longer than 4 lines (not counting 
<code>makeV</code>)...</p>
