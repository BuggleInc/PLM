<h2>Buggle Dance Revolution (BDR)</h2>

<p>After these races, it's time to party! For that, we will teach the buggles to 
play Dance Revolution, this game beloved of some students: The player has 
to move the feet on the carpet according to the instructions presented on the 
screen, and following the music. But before that, we have some details to study first.</p>

[!java|scala|c]
<h3>Conditionals without curly braces</h3>
<p>
There is one detail we omitted about the conditional syntax: if a branch
contains only one instruction, then the curly braces become optional. So,
the two chunk of code are equivalent:</p>

 <pre>if (<b>condition</b>) {
    <b>whatToDoIfTheConditionIsTrue();</b>
} else {
    <b>whatToDoElse();</b>
}</pre>
 <pre>if (<b>condition</b>) 
    <b>whatToDoIfTheConditionIsTrue();</b>
else
    <b>whatToDoElse();</b></pre>

<p>Actually, you can do the same for loops body that are reduced to one instruction only. 
But beware, this becomes dangerous if you chain the <tt>if</tt> instructions like this: </p>
<pre>if (isOverBaggle())    
     if (x == 5)
          left();
else
     right();
[!c]stepForward();[/!][!java|scala]forward();[/!]</pre>

<p>In fact, it does not turn right when there is no baggle on the ground AND x
equals 5, but when the buggle found a baggle on the ground and x equals
anything but 5. Putting this otherwise, the buggle understands the previous
code as if it were written the following way (note that the <tt>else</tt>
were moved to the right):</p>
<pre>if (isOverBaggle())    
        if (x == 5)
            left();
        else
            right();
[!c]stepForward();[/!][!java|scala]forward();[/!]</pre>

<p>The first lesson of this is that the indentation is very important to help
humans understanding, even if it does not change the actual meaning of
the code. We could have written the following code and obtain the same
result. But if you want a human to read and review your code, you
really want to indent it correctly. That's for example the case if you want
a professor to read it (to grade it or to answer a question about it), or if
you want to reuse your code later, or even if you need to debug your code yourself.</p> 

<pre>if (isOverBaggle()) if (x == 5) left(); else right(); [!c]stepForward();[/!][!java|scala]forward();[/!]</pre>

<p>The second lesson is that a <tt>else</tt> branch always connects to the
closest <tt>if</tt>. This may be a bit troublesome in some case, and it may
be easier to add more braces than strictly needed to remove any ambiguity.</p>
[/!]

<h3>Chaining conditionals</h3>

<p>You sometimes want to ask the buggle something similar to:</p> 
<pre>if it's raining, take an umbrella;
if not, and if it's a hot day, take a bottle of water;
if not and if it's July 4th, take an American flag</pre>

<p>The trap is that we want at most one of these actions to be taken. That is
to say, if it's raining a very hot July 4th, we don't want the buggle to get
outside with an umbrella, some water and a flag, but simply with an
umbrella. The following code is thus WRONG.</p>

<pre>[!scala|c|java]if (rainy())
    takeUmbrella();
if (hot())
    takeWater();
if (todayIsJuly4th())
    takeFlag();[/!][!python]if rainy():
    takeUmbrella()
if hot():
    takeWater()
if todayIsJuly4th():
    takeFlag()[/!]</pre>


<p>Indeed, since the conditions are evaluated one after the other, there is a
risk that you go to the July 4th march on a rainy day. Instead, we should
use something like this to ensure that once we found a true condition, we won't
evaluate the next ones.</p>

<pre>[!java|scala|c]if (rainy()) {
    takeUmbrella();
} else {
    if (hotDay()) {
        takeWater();
    } else {
        if (todayIsJuly4th()) {
            takeFlag();
        }
    }
}[/!][!python]if rainy():
    takeUmbrella()
else:
    if hotDay():
        takeWater()
    else:
        if todayIsJuly4th():
            takeFlag()[/!]</pre>


<p>Unfortunately, such a cascade of conditionals is quite difficult to read. It is better to 
[!java|scala|c]omit the curly braces for the <tt>else</tt> statements. Some languages
even introduce a specific construct for these <tt>else if</tt>, but not [!thelang].[/!]
[!python]change the sub-blocks using the <code>elif</code> keyword to mark
explicitly these "else if" branches.[/!]
</p>

<pre>[!c|java|scala]if (rainy()) { 
    takeUmbrella();
} else if (hotDay()) {
    takeWater();
} else if (todayIsJuly4th()) {
    takeFlag();
}[/!][!python]if rainy():
    takeUmbrella()
elif hotDay():
    takeWater()
elif todayIsJuly4th():
    takeFlag()[/!]</pre>

<h3>Graffiti in the Buggle World</h3>

<p>Buggles can tag graffitis on the ground of their world. For that, they use
the four following methods:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>[!c]int[/!][!java]boolean[/!] isOverMessage()[!scala]:Boolean[/!]</code>: 
    returns <code>[!c]1[/!][!java|scala]true[/!][!python]True[/!]</code> if and only if there is a
    message on the ground.</li>
  <li><code>[!c]char*[/!][!java]String[/!] readMessage()[!scala]: String[/!]</code>: 
    returns the message written on the ground (or an empty string if nothing is written).</li>
  <li><code>[!java|c]void[/!] writeMessage([!c]char*[/!][!java]String [/!]msg[!scala]: String[/!])</code>:
    writes the specified message down on the ground. If there is already a message on the
    ground, the new content is added at the end of the existing message.</li>
  <li><code>[!java|c]void [/!]clearMessage()</code>: clears what is written on the ground.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Exercise goal</h3>The goal is then to organize a BDR game between the
buggles by teaching them to move according to the instructions written on
the ground. These instructions are messages written on the ground, with the
following signification:

<table border="1">
 <tr><td>Message</td>
     <td>What to do</td>
     <td>Mnemonic</td></tr>

 <tr><td>[!java|c]'R'[/!][!scala|python]"R"[/!]</td><td>Turn right and move one step forward</td><td>Right</td></tr>
 <tr><td>[!java|c]'L'[/!][!scala|python]"L"[/!]</td><td>Turn left and move one step forward</td><td>Left</td></tr>
 <tr><td>[!java|c]'I'[/!][!scala|python]"I"[/!]</td><td>Turn back (U-turn) and move one step forward</td><td>Inverse</td></tr>

 <tr><td>[!java|c]'A'[/!][!scala|python]"A"[/!]</td><td>Move one step forward</td><td>First letter of the alphabet</td></tr>
 <tr><td>[!java|c]'B'[/!][!scala|python]"B"[/!]</td><td>Move two steps forward</td><td>Second letter of the alphabet</td></tr>
 <tr><td>[!java|c]'C'[/!][!scala|python]"C"[/!]</td><td>Move three steps forward</td><td>Third letter of the alphabet</td></tr>

 <tr><td>[!java|c]'Z'[/!][!scala|python]"Z"[/!]</td><td>Move one step backward</td><td>One letter before the end of the alphabet</td></tr>
 <tr><td>[!java|c]'Y'[/!][!scala|python]"Y"[/!]</td><td>Move two steps backward</td><td>Two letters before the end of the alphabet</td></tr>
 <tr><td>[!java|c]'X'[/!][!scala|python]"X"[/!]</td><td>Move three steps backward</td><td>Three letters before the end of the alphabet</td></tr>
 <tr><td><i>(anything else)</i></td><td>Stop dancing.</td><td></td></tr>
</table>

<h3>Indications</h3>

This exercise may seem a bit complex at the first glance, but it comes down
to summarizing the information of the table in a sequence of conditionals.

<p>You have to keep dancing as long as there is some dancing steps to do,
i.e., as long as we are in a cell which content is described in the table. 
The easier for that is to use a boolean variable (<code>finished</code>)
as termination condition to a <code>while</code> loop.
It should be initialized to <code>[!c]0[/!][!java|scala]false[/!][!python]False[/!]</code>, and 
switched to <code>[!c]1[/!][!java|scala]true[/!][!python]True[/!]</code>
as soon as the buggle find a cell with a value not described in the table.
Thus, the loop will stop and the program will terminate. </p>

[!java|c]
<p>Another subtlety is that detecting if strings are equals is a bit annoying in [!thelang].
So, we use the <code>char getIndication[!c]Bdr[/!]()</code> instead of <code>[!java]String[/!][!c]char*[/!] readMessage()</code>. 

This method, only known by the buggles of this exercise, returns the first char of the message written on the ground 
(or ' ' -- the space char --  if nothing is written down). It enables to work with chars instead of strings, that is 
much simpler in [!thelang].</p>
[/!]

<h3>Tips and Hints</h3>

If you fail to understand why the buggle does not execute the expected
steps, try adding <code>brushDown()</code> in your method. This asks the
buggle to put down a brush leaving a trail when it moves. It should help you
understanding its trajectory, but do not forget to remove this call when you
want to test whether your code is a valid solution to the exercise: you are
asked to let the buggle dance, not to vandalize the dance floor.

<p>When your program finally works, move on to the next exercise.</p>
