<h2>Methodically drawing</h2>

In this exercise, we will reproduce the geometric drawing that you can see
in the "Objective" tab.

<p>Your goal (here and in any well written program) is to write the simplest
possible <code>run()</code>. For that, you have to decompose your work in
sub-steps, and write a specific method for each sub-step.</p>

<p>If you observe carefully the picture to draw, it is constituted of four
parts depicting a sort of V using a different color. A possible
decomposition is to write a method in charge of drawing a V of the specified
color from the current position. Its prototype can be: 
<pre>void makeV(Color c)</pre>

<p>The <code>Color</code> data type naturally describes a particular
color. Your <code>run()</code> method should probably call
<code>makeV</code> with the following arguments (a different color for each
call):
<ul>
<li>Color.yellow</li>
<li>Color.red</li>
<li>Color.blue</li>
<li>Color.green</li>
</ul>

<p>In <code>makeV()</code>, you should use the <code>setBrushColor()</code>
method (predefined in the buggle) to change the color of the buggle's brush,
as well as <code>brushUp()</code> and <code>brushDown()</code> to change the
brush position.</p>
 
<p>It may be wise to write the <code>makeV()</code> so that it places directly
the buggle in position for the next V.</p>
 
<p>Your turn. The <code>run()</code> method should not be longer than 4
lines...</p>
