## Methodically drawing (only bigger) ##
We will now reproduce an even bigger geometrical drawing. Once again, you
can see the model by clicking on the "Objective" tab.

You can naturally reuse all the code you typed in previous exercise (select
the other exercise, do Ctrl-C, come back to the code of this exercise, do
Ctrl-V).

But you want to keep your ` run()` as simple as possible. For
that, define new methods to deal simply with the repetitions in the
pattern. For example, a method ` makePattern()` achieving the
pattern of previous example seems to be a good idea (but this may not be
enough).

Why don't you give it a shot? The ` run()` method shouldn't take
more than 2 lines (included in a for loop)

To proceed to the next exercise, you need to remark that the combobox used
to switch the exercise have a scroll bar that you can use to see the next
exercises of the lesson.
