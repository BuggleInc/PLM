<h2>Writing more complex programs</h2>
  Now that we know how to draw things on the board, we'll enjoy this ability and 
  draw a beautiful G on the board (check Objective panel for details on what's 
  expected). 

  <p>When you write a quite complex program, it is sometimes useful to <b>add
   comments</b> to simplify the code reviews afterward. Here for example, it's 
   quite easy to get lost in the drawing process, and you may want to add 
   comments like <i>vertical bar done</i> or <i>finished drawing the G. Time to 
   move back to initial position</i>. Commenting your code is almost mandatory if you 
   (or someone else) want to read it afterward, although overcommenting 
   (describing obvious stuff) is a bad idea as the important idea get lost in the noise.</p>
   
  <p class="Java">There is three types of comments in Java, instructing the compiler 
   to not read the text you add for humans:</p>
  <p class="Python">There is two types of comments in Python, instructing the compiler 
   to not read the text you add for humans:</p>
   
  <ul class="Java">
    <li class="Java"><b>Comments on a single line</b>. When the compiler encounters the symbols //,
      it ignores the end of the line.</li>      
    <li class="Java"><b>Comments on several lines</b>. The compiler ignores anything placed
      between the symbols /* and */ even if they are placed on differing lines.</li>
  </ul>

  <ul class="Python">
    <li class="Python"><b>Comments on a single line</b>. When the compiler encounters the symbol #,
      it ignores the end of the line.</li>
    <li class="Python"><b>Comments on several lines</b>. The compiler ignores anything placed
      between a line beginning with ''' and the next line ending with '''.</li>

  <p class="Java">There is a third kind of comments in Java, between /** and */, which are read by a
specific program called JavaDoc to generate automatically the documentation
explaining how to use the code. These comments must follow a very precise
formalism.</p>

  <p class="Python">The comments on several lines are often used to document how to use the code, while others 
  are more used to describe how this code works.</p>
