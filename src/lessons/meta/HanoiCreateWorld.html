<h1>Creating a new JLM world</h1>

<p>
Welcome to the JLM Meta-Lesson. Its goal is to teach you how to write
new universes in JLM. For that, we will reimplement the Hanoi world
(available in the recursion lesson) step-by-step. This lesson covers quite 
advanced topics and suppose that you are fluent in Java and confident with the use
of the JLM framework already. If you are not used to the framework already, you 
probably want to take another lesson before, like the welcome one or 
(maybe more fun) the maze one.</p>

<p>Every JLM universe is composed of 4 main components:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>The world</b>: it contains the state of the universe.</li>
<li><b>The view</b>: it allows to draw the world and the entities on
the screen.</li>
<li><b>The entity ancestor</b>: the code written by the student will
derive from this class, which contains some state specific to the
entity, and every accessor to let the entity interact with its world. </li>
<li><b>The entity interactive control panel</b>: this is the little
panel displayed under the world view in the JLM interface. It allows
to interactively control the selected entity. As you can see from the
existing universes, this is optional, and if you don't provide any,
the panel will remain blank, preventing the users from interactively
controlling the entities.</li>
</ul>

<p>In addition, worlds are used by exercises, themselves sorted in lessons.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Lessons</b> are just a list of exercise. They can be sequential 
(meaning that the student has to finish one exercise before being allowed to 
see the next one in the list), altrough most of them are not (ie, students are 
free to attempt the exercises in the order they like). 

<p>In the future, we would like to have richer exercise ordering schema, where
the requirements to fulfill to be allowed to try an exercise could be more complex. 
The dependencies would probably turn into a graph instead of a chain. 
But this is still to be done.</p>

<p>The main element of each lesson is a class classically called Main, which simply 
contains a constructor adding each exercise of the lesson in row.</p></li>

<li>Each <b>exercise</b> object is in charge of instantiating the worlds used, set
them up (adding walls and baggles in BuggleWorld, or changing the elevation and 
adding lamps in the LightBotWorld, etc), and populate them with entities correctly 
setup (location, color, etc).</li>

<li>Most of the exercises also provide a specific <b>answer entity</b> able to solve the exercise. 
It serve both to compute the initial content of the code editor, and to compute the 
objective world. We will come back on this in a latter exercise of this meta-lesson.</li>  
</ul>

<p>The very first element you want to write in a new JLM universe is a
partial world implementation including the internal state. In subsequent exercises, we 
will complete the World class to provide entities ways to interact and modify their world, 
and we will also implement the other elements of the universe.</p>

<p>Before you jump in writing your World implementation, you should understand the big JLM 
picture, and how worlds are used internally.</p>

<h2>JLM worlds big picture</h2>

<p>
As you know, every JLM exercise can contain one or several worlds, each
containing one or several entities. The code written by the student is
executed in the entities, which must interact with their world to change 
it from its initial state to its goal state. 
</p>
<p>This multiplication of worlds and entities is used to test the student 
code in several conditions. It can thus be parallelized to test cases, aiming 
at full testing coverage of the student code.</p>

<p>Technically, in a given exercise, for every world accessible from the 
relevant combobox, there is three World objects. They live in jlm.lesson.Exercise:
<pre>
protected World [] initialWorld; 
protected World [] currentWorld; 
protected World [] answerWorld;  
</pre>
</p>

<p>
The line number of the combobox gives the index to use in these arrays. 
Each <code>initialWorld</code> is created by the exercise constructor. 
</p>

<p><code>currentWorld</code> is the one 
displayed in the "World" tab of the interface. At the beginning, it is a plain copy 
of the initialWorld, but it gets modified when the student uses the interactive 
controls or when the program gets run. The "Reset" button reset it to be a perfect 
copy of the initial world.</p>
  
<p><code>answerWorld</code> is the one displayed by the "Objective" world. Basically, it's a copy 
of the initial world, on which we let the specific answer entity of this exercise run. 
This default behavior can be overloaded by exercises, but you'll probably never have 
to do so. We will come back on this in a subsequent exercise.</p>

<h3>Implementing basic Worlds</h3>
<p>
The internal use of Worlds hidden, but the important point is that every World object 
has extend the jlm.universe.World class and define the following methods and constructors:
<ul>
<li><b>a copy constructor</b> which is used to copy initial worlds into currentWorld and answerWorld. 
Its argument must be of the exact same type than the class itself, not Object (this is because we use 
Java introspection mechanism to search for such a constructor of the class). 
For example, if you create a TotoWorld, your copy constructor must be declared as this:
<pre>
public TotoWorld(TotoWorld other) {...} // Correct
public TotoWorld(Object other) {...} // FALSE
public TotoWorld(World other) {...} // also FALSE
</pre>  
The content of this constructor is usually a simple call to the <code>super(World w)</code> constructor, but 
this constructor cannot be omitted.
</li>
<li>One or several <b>regular constructors</b> initializing the state of the object. They will be used 
by the exercise constructor to instantiate your world. Since you usually write both the world and the lessons, 
you are completely free to specify the parameters you want to your constructor. It should use the 
<code>super(String name)</code> constructor to setup the very basic elements of your world. 

<p>Optionally, you may also want to use the <code>setDelay(int delay)</code> method to change the initial 
animation delay. For example, the SortingWorld set this to 1 to speed animations up. This is the 
delay in milliseconds between each animation step during a continuous run.</p></li>

<li>A <b>reset() method</b> taking one World as parameter, and in charge of copying the state of the parameter 
into the current world. This is naturally used when you press the "Reset" button, or at the beginning of each run.

<p>The length of this method naturally depends on the complexity of your world state. In hanoi, there is 
only 3 slots containing a list of disc so that will be quite easy, but this can be quite complicated for 
complex worlds such as BuggleWorld.</p></li>
</ul>
</p>
<h3>Allowing the graphical rendering of Worlds</h3>
<p>
Some specific steps naturally must be taken so that JLM can graphically display your world. Usually, you must
write a specific class extending jlm.universe.WorldView, and provide some protected methods so that the View can
retrieve the state to display. In this particular exercise, the view is provided (you will write you own one 
in next exercise), so you only have to implement the right accessor.
</p>
<h2>Implementing your HanoiWorld</h2>
<p>
The main task of this exercise is to modify the provided template to store the state of the world. Since the exercise
provides a view and automatically instantiate your world, you cannot change the instantiation constructor, nor the 
rendering accessor (see the code template for there prototype). But you are completely free about how you actually 
store the state in your object. 
</p>
<p>During the implementation of the Hanoi world, I changed my internal representation several times, to adapt to 
the code needs. My first try was only simply three ArrayList&lt;Integer>, for each slots, while the final design used
an inner class called HanoiSlot, containing an integer array and providing friendly functions such as 
<code>push()</code>, <code>pop()</code> and <code>top()</code>. Even if it really becomes necessary when 
implementing the action methods allowing the entities to interact with their world, I advise you to design an 
inner class from the beginning.</p>

<p>You probably want to add 3 fields to your World, one for each slot (we will never try to have worlds with more 
than 3 slots), store the content of each slot in the instantiation constructor, and retrieve the content of a 
specific slot in the rendering accessor (<code>Integer[] values(Integer i)</code>).</p>

<p>That seems quite a lot of code to write compared to the other JLM exercises, but at the end, my HanoiWorld 
implementation is less than 100 lines long, which is not that much.</p>
