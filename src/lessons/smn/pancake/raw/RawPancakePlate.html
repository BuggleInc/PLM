<h1>PancakeWorld</h1>
<p>
This world implements the control freak pancake seller problem, who wants his pancakes to be sorted on their plate from the biggest to the smallest.
</p>
<p>
You are asked to resort a pancakes stack to make him happy. Since it is obviously forbidden to place a pancake on the dirty table, the only allowed action is to flip one or more pancakes on the top of the stack.
A pancake is defined by its radius and position on the stack, from the top to the bottom. These characteristics are positive integers.
</p>
<div>
Only three functions are provided :
<p>
<pre>int getStackSize()</pre>

Returns the size of the stack, in other words the amount of pancakes it contains.
</p><p>
<pre>int getPancakeRadius(int pancakeNumber)</pre>

Returns the radius of the pancake you gave in argument.
</p><p>
<pre>void flip(int numberOfPancakes)</pre>

Flips the <code>numberOfPancakes</code> first pancakes composing the stack, from the top of it.
</p>
</div>
