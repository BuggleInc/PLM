<h1>Baseball</h1>
<p>
Like the previous world, this world implements a baseball world. But now, you have more than two players on each base.
Like before, your mission is to bring everyone home.
</p>
<p>
This exercise is trying to show you one thing :  you have to do a change that you haven't anticipated, and 
you need to make this change without breaking your code and without changing too many thing, because the algorithm is still great.
</p>
<p>
The previous algorithm was only able to deal with two players per base, you have to change it so you can handle n players per base, 
with n greater or equals at two.
</p>
<p>
You can be wondering why you didn't have to write directly an flawless algorithm. It's just that sometimes, it's way too hard.
Sometimes, you just need to take a particular case and generalize your solution. It's sometimes easier to generalize than to try to find 
a general algorithm from scratch. Remember that improving is way more easier than creating.
<p>
Memento:
<ul>
<li>
You can have access to the number of locations available on each base by using the getLocationsAmount() method.
</li>
<li>
The color of a base is given by its index. 
</li>
<li>
The hole has a color of -1.
</li>
<li>
The base which has only one player on the field has <i>getAmountOfBases()-1</i> as index
</li>
</ul>
</p>

<div>
There are seven methods provided :
<p>
<pre>void move(int baseSrc, int playerSrc)</pre>

Move the player on position <code>playerLocation</code> from the base <code>baseSrc</code> to the hole.
</p><p>
<pre>int getPlayerColor(int baseIndex, int playerLocation) </pre>

Return the color of the player on position <code>playerLocation</code> ( 0 or 1 ) from the base <code>baseIndex</code>.
The color -1 is the hole.
</p><p>
<pre>int getHoleBase() </pre>

Return the index of the base where the hole is located
</p><p>
<pre>int getHolePositionInBase()</pre>

Return the player's position in the base where the hole is located
</p><p>	
<pre>boolean isBaseSorted( int baseIndex)</pre>

Return TRUE if all players of the base <code>baseSrc</code> are home  
</p><p>
<pre>int getAmountOfBases()</pre>

Return the amount of bases in the field.
</p>
<p>
<pre>int getLocationsAmount()</pre>

Return the amount of players locations available on each base of the field
