<h1>Turtle Art</h1>

<p>Since its inception in the 60's, the LOGO turtle fascinates by its ability
to draw nice figures on computer.  This lesson allows you to explore some of
the classical figures, and draw your own.</p>

<p>The language's syntax is absolutely not presented, but if you know a bit of
it or if someone tells you, you can take these exercises even if you are an
absolute beginner in programming.</p>

<p>Please send us your best contributions so that they get added to this

<h3>O que eu posso fazer para melhorar este universo do PLM?</h3>

<p>Como sempre, existem várias coisas que podem ser feitas no código
deste universo para melhorá-lo:</p>

moving or by moving to the end of the arc.</li>
