<h1>Turtle Art</h1>

<p>Since its inception in the 60's, the LOGO turtle fascinates by its ability to draw nice figures on computer. 
This lesson allows you to explore some of the classical figures, and draw your own.</p>

<p>The language's syntax is absolutely not presented, but if you know a bit of it or if someone tells you, 
you can take these exercises even if you are an absolute beginner in programming.</p>

<p>Please send us your best contributions so that they get added to this gallery to inspire the next ones.</p>

<h3>What can I do to improve this PLM universe?</h3>

<p>As usual, there are several things that could be done in the code of this universe to improve it:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Other exercises should be added. A whole lot of exercises are
   available from <a href="http://neoparaiso.com/logo/#sect4">http://neoparaiso.com/logo/#sect4</a>

  <li>Missing: the built-ins arc() and arcTo(), that draw an arc, either w/o moving or by moving to the end of the arc.</li>
