<h2>Lunar Lander</h2>

<p>In this universe you pilot a lunar lander. At each simulation step you're
given the lander's position, speed, angle and thrust and must issue a
command adjusting its angle and thrust.</p>

<h2>Funções fornecidas</h2>

<pre>[!java|c]double [/!]getX()[!scala]:Double[/!]
[!java|c]double [/!]getY()[!scala]:Double[/!]</pre>
Obter (Get) as posições X e Y do "lander".
<pre>[!java|c]double [/!]getVelocidadeX()[!scala]:Double[/!]
[!java|c]double [/!]getVelocidadeY()[!scala]:Double[/!]</pre>
Get the horizontal and vertical speed of the lander.

<pre>[!java|c]double [/!]getÂngulo()[!scala]:Double[/!]
[!java|c]void [/!]setÂnguloDesejado([!java|c]double [/!]ÂnguloDesejado[!scala]:Double[/!])</pre>
Get or set the angle of the lander.<br/>
An angle of 0° denotes a vertical position where the "head" of the lander
points up.  This is the angle you must land with. A positive angle denotes a
left-leaning lander, a negative angle a right-leaning one. You cannot lean
more than by ±90°, and the angle can vary by at most ±5° in one step.

<pre>[!java|c]int [/!]getImpulso()[!scala]:Int[/!]
[!java|c]void [/!]setImpulsoDesejado([!java|c]int [/!]thrust[!scala]:Int[/!])</pre>
Get or set the thrust of the lander. <br/>You can only increment or decrement the thrust by 1 between two simulation
steps, so if the current thrust is 2 and you ask for 4, you'll only get 3 in
the next step. If you ask for less than 0 (resp. more than 4), everything
will be as if you had asked for 0 (resp. 4).

<pre>[!java|c]int [/!]getCombustível()[!scala]:Int[/!]</pre>
Get the remaining fuel in the lander.  At each step of the simulation the
lander consumes as many fuel units as the current thrust. Once you run out
of fuel you're in free fall so beware!

<pre>[!java]List&lt;Point&gt; [/!]getChão()[! scala]:List[Point][/!]</pre>
Get the vertices of the ground's profile from left to right.
[!java|scala]You can retrieve the X and Y coordinates of each point with the
corresponding methods of your point: <code>p.x()</code> and
<code>p.y()</code>.[/!] [!python]Each point is an array of two integers
denoting respectively the X and Y coordinates of that point.[/!]
