<h1>Welcome</h1>

<p>Welcome to the lightbot world. This is merely a programmer puzzle rather than a real lesson (although some use it to teach programming).
The robot is not programmed in Java, but rather graphically. You can see the existing orders in the documentation using the <i>About this world</i> menu.<</p>

<p>The goal of each board is simply to switch on every lights of the board using your little robot.</p>

<p>This is a introduction exercise, which should be solvable by only moving forward and switching the light, using respectively <img src="resources/lightbot/forward.png" /> and <img src="resources/lightbot/light.png" />.</p>
