<h2>Sierpinski's Triangle</h2>

The fractal we will now draw is formed of a big triangle inside which
several smaller triangles are embeeded. The prototype of the fuction to draw
it is the following:</p>
<pre>[!java]void [/!]sierpinski([!java]int [/!]level[!scala]:Int[/!], [!java]double [/!]length[!scala]:Double[/!])</pre>

<p>Have a look at each world's objective view to understand how to write the
function.</p>
