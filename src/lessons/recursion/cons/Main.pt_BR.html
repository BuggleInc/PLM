<h1>Recursive Lists</h1>
<p>This lesson contains a bunch of classical exercises on recursive lists.  It
is certainly not the most pleasant lesson to do, but I think that it is the
easiest of the PLM lessons dealing with recursion.</p>

<p>Como sempre, existem várias coisas que podem ser feitas no código
deste universo para melhorá-lo:</p>

<ul>
<li>New exercises could be proposed, such as
http://webloria.loria.fr/~quinson/Teaching/TOP/02-td-recursivite-enonce.pdf
If you know some others, please report them as an issue.</li>
<li>It would be interesting to check the asymptotic complexity of the student's
code, but that does not sound easy to do. In Python and Java (where we
provide a hand-made RecList class), we could count the amount of cons per
exercise, but it won't be easy to relate this to the right BatTest. For
Scala, it sounds even more difficult as we use the classical :: operators of
the language. That will be difficult to override to add a counting
mechanism. Another solution would be to ensure that the call stack does not
pass a given threshold, but that sounds very difficult too. Any idea is
welcome.</li>
<ul>
