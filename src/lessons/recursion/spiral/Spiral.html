<h2>Spirals</h2>

We will now draw our first recursive function with the turtle. The goal is
to draw different kind of spirals with the same function, which prototype is
the following: 
<pre>void spiral(int steps, int angle, int length, int increment)</pre>

To help you understanding how to write it, here is an example of how the
parameters change during one specific call:
<pre>
spiral(5, 90, 0, 3);
  forward(0);
  turnLeft(90);
  spiral(4,90,3,3);
    forward(3);
    turnLeft(90);
    spiral(3,90,6,3);
      forward(6);
      turnLeft(90);
      spiral(2,90,9,3);
        forward(9);
        turnLeft(90);
        spiral(1,90,12,3);
          forward(12);
          turnLeft(90);
          spiral(0,90,12,3);
</pre>
