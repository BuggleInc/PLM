<h2>Drawing spirals</h2>

Can you reproduce the provided patterns of this exercise using the
<code>spiral()</code> method?

<p>You must provide a method called <code>doit(int)</code> taking the number of
the page to draw as parameter. Its code is as following, with A0, B0, etc
being integers. The goal of this exercise is to find the good values for
each page.</p>

<pre>
void doit(int page) {
  switch (page) {
    case 0: /* Drawing of the first page, dubbed "One" */
      spiral(A0,B0,C0,D0);
      break;
    case 1: /* Drawing of the second page, dubbed "Two" */
      spiral(A1,B1,C1,D1);
      break;
    case 2: /* Drawing of the page dubbed "Three" */
      spiral(A2,B2,C2,D2);
      break;
    case 3: /* Drawing of the page dubbed "Four" */
      spiral(A3,B3,C3,D3);
      break;
    case 4: /* Drawing of the page dubbed "Five" */
      spiral(A4,B4,C4,D4);
      break;
  }
}
</pre>


<p>No need to copy over the method of <code>spiral()</code>, the turtle of this
exercise already knows it.</p>
