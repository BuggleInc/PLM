<h2>Three little circles</h2>

As we saw (and as you can check in the documentation of this world under
"About this world"), turtles can only draw straight lines. Despite of this,
the goal of this world is to draw circles... This can be achived simply by
realizing that a circle can be seen as a concatenation of very little
segments.

<p>Differential calculus would even argue that a circle is the asymptotical
limit of such construct when the size of each segment becomes infinitely
small while their amount becomes infinitely large (but it is still possible
to solve this exercise without understanding differential calculus).</p>

<h3>Goal of this exercise</h3> 

Write a function drawing a circle, taking the size of each of the 360
segments as parameter. Then use it in your <code>run()</code> method to draw
the whole picture. The first circle is obtained with segments of size 0.5,
the second with segments of size 1 and the last one with 1.5-long
segments. Once again, this is a hand-on exercise, no recursion is needed.
