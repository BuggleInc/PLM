<h2>Snow flake</h2>

We will now draw snow flakes using the Koch fractal. A fractal is a
geometrical pattern repeated at every scale.

<p>The general form is a triangle, with each side given by a serie of recursive
calls. The general form is given by something like this:
<pre>void snowFlake (int levels, double length) {
   snowSide(levels, length);
   turnRight(120);
   snowSide(levels, length);
   turnRight(120);
   snowSide(levels, length);
   turnRight(120);
}</pre>

<p>Observe the drawing in each world's objective to understand the pattern's
logic, and then reproduce it. You must write the <code>snowSide()</code>
method, which is recursive.
