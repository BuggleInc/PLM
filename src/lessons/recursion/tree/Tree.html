<h2>Trees</h2>

We will now draw trees. For that, we will write a method using double
recursion following this prototype 
<pre>void tree(int steps, double length, double angle, double shrink)</pre>

<p>To draw a tree of four levels, you have to draw a trunk of the given length,
turn right of the given angle, draw a tree of level 3, turn left twice of
the given angle, draw another tree of level 3, and come back to your initial
location. 

<p>If a tree's trunk is of length 'len', the trunk of the next level tree will
be of length 'len*shrink'.
