<h2>Snow flake</h2>

We will now draw snow flakes using the Koch fractal. A fractal is a
geometric pattern repeated at every scale.

<p>The general form is a triangle, with each side given by several recursive
calls. Your work is only to write the code of the <code>snowSide</code> method so 
that it draws one side of the triangle. To make it easier, each sides are represented 
in a specific color. Just draw the red things (without changing your pen color), 
and the other colors will be drawn automatically. </p>

<p>Observe the drawing in each world's objective to understand the pattern's
logic, and then reproduce it. At level 0, the Koch curve is just a straight line. 
At level 1, the curve is divided in three thirds, and the middle part is replaced by 
the two sides of an equilateral triangle of the same length as the segment being removed.
At level 2, the process is repeated, whith each segments split in three parts and the 
middle part being replaced by the two sides of an equilateral triangle.</p>

<p>The pseudo-code of the general case is the following:</p>
<pre>
  Draw recursively a smaller segment
  Turn 60 degrees to the left
  Draw recursively a smaller segment  
  Turn 120 degrees to the right
  Draw recursively a smaller segment
  Turn 60 degrees to the left
  Draw recursively a smaller segment
</pre>
<p>As you can see, the function forward() is not called from the recursive case, only 
in the base case when there is no recursive call.</p>

<p>Here are the results of the first levels of recursion.</p>

<p>You must write the <code>snowSide()</code> method, which is recursive but 
<b>do not call snowFlake from snowSide</b>, or you will get very strange and unexpected 
behaviors.</p>
