<h2>The small cousines of Buggles</h2>

Today, we will meet the small cousines of the buggles: the turtles. In fact,
turtles are much olders than the buggles. They were invented in the 70's by
a scientific from MIT called Seymour Papert to help teaching programming,
and the buggles are a variation on the idea invented by Lyn Turbak from
Wellesley College later.

<p>Turtles are thus a bit like buggles, but smaller. Just like buggles, you can
order them to move forward, to turn, to move backward, etc. Just like
buggles, they leave a line on their path when they move (but the line is
much smaller).

<p>The main difference is that where buggles can only move of right angles,
turtles can move of any arbitrary angles specified by a real number (a
double). This gives them much more liberty in their movings. The buggles can
do several other tricks, like reading and writting messages, picking or
dropping objects, and there is sometimes walls in their worlds (but all this
is completely above the capacities of turtles).

<p>From a practical point of view, most of the methods you knew about buggles
still work with turtles, with some minor adaptations. In particular, the
<code>forward()</code> method takes the amount of steps to do as a double
(see "About this world" for more details).

<h3>Doubles? But what is it?</h3>
It's simply a point number. Example:
<pre>
double x = 3.72;
x + 1.234 // Value = 4.954
x + 2 // Value = 5.72 (2 converted to 2.0 automatically)
x * 2 // Value = 7.44 (2 converted to 2.0 automatically)
x / 2 // Value = 1.86 (2 converted to 2.0 automatically)
(int) x // Value = 1 (“casting to int”, converted to integer by truncating)
Math.round(x) // Value = 2 (1.86 rounded to nearest integer)
Math.floor(x) // Value = 1 (1.86 rounded toward minus infinity)
Math.floor(-5.12) // Value = -6 (rounded toward minus infinity)
Math.ceiling(x) // Value = 2 (1.86 rounded toward plus infinity)
Math.ceiling(-5.12) // Value = -5 (rounded toward plus infinity)
(double) 17 // Value = 17.0 (“casted to double”, converted to double)
</pre>

<h3>Goal of this exercise</h3>
Even if this is the first exercise on the recursivity lesson, the code you
have to write is not recursive. The goal is to get familiar with the turtle
world before getting on serious matter.

<p>You must reproduce a simple geometrical painting constituted of four 100
steps long squares (see the objective world for more details). It is
obviously a good idea to write a method to draw a square, and then use it in
your <code>run()</code> in charge of doing the work. You must absolutely
write at least the run method, which prototype is the following:
<pre>
public void run() {
  // write here what your turtle is supposed to do
}</pre>
