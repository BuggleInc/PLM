<h2>Fast Split Towers of Hanoi</h2>

<p>Again, our previous solution is working, but it is far from being optimal.
When moving the towers, we use the algorithm for 3 pegs even if we have 4
pegs.  Of course, movements to the last peg are restricted since it contains
the other stack, but we can always store the smallest disk on top of the
other stack before moving our stack.</p>

<p>For that, we need to devise a new function <code>hanoi_fast(height, src,
free, full, dst)</code> that moves the stack from <code>src</code> to
<code>dst</code> using <code>free</code>, but storing the smallest disk onto
<code>full</code> beforehand.</p>

<div class="tip" id="tip-1" alt="I'm lost">
The <code>hanoi_fast(height, src, free, full, dst)</code> function is not
recursive.  It moves the first disk and then call the regular
<code>hanoi()</code> function.
</div> <br>

<p>This change greatly improve the performance, as you can see below. Of
course, this trick could also be used for the interleaved algorithm, leading
as expected to the exact same performance.</p>
<table border="1">
<tr><td>Disks amount</td><td>Interleaved</td><td>Slow Split</td><td>Fast Split</td></tr>
<tr><td>5 пар</td>     <td> 62 ходи</td>  <td> 88 ходів </td><td> 46 ходів</td></tr>
<tr><td>6 пар</td>     <td>126 ходів</td>  <td>183 ходи </td><td> 82 ходи</td></tr>
<tr><td>7 пар</td>     <td>254 ходи</td>  <td>374 ходи </td><td>150 ходів</td></tr>
</table>

<p>As a conclusion, most of us are satisfied with a working solution and we
easily overlook possibilities to improve the problem
decomposition. <b>You</b> should not do that ;)</p>
