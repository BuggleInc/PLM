<h2>Turtles in the stars</h2>

This is the last hand-on turtles exercise before recursion. The goal is to
draw three 5-branches stars. Like any regular stars with N branches, the
angle at each external corners are 360/N degrees while the angles between
branches are of 2*360/N degrees.

<p>The first star to draw is black (<code>Color.black</code>) and its branches
are 100 steps long. The second is blue (<code>Color.blue</code>) and its
branches are 80 steps long. It's shifted of 45 degrees from the first
one. The last star is red (<code>Color.red</code>), its branches are 60
steps long and it's shifted of 45 degrees from the previous one.</p>

<p>Observe the world's objective to visualize the picture to draw.</p>
