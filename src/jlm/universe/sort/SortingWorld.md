# Sorting World #
This world provides tools to experiment with the sorting algorithms. It can
be used in two different ways: the first one is naturally to write the
required sorting algorithms. But it is also possible to simply use the demo
mode of each exercise to observe the behavior of sorting algorithms. It
helps understanding the differences between each of them. ## Methods available to sorting algorithms ##
