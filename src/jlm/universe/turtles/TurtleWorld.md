# TurtleWorld #
This world is directly inspired from the work of the mathematician Seymour
Papert in the 60's. Inspirated from the swiss psycholog Jean Piaget, he came
up with a learning method called LOGO to teach programming to young
childs. The world is full of turtles which leave a painting where they go
and which respond to simple orders.

This world is an adaptation of LOGO for the Java Learning Machine.
