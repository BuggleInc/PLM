# LightBotWorld #
This world introduces a little programming puzzle which can somehow be used to introduce programmation to non-reading kids since it is programmed graphically.
The goal of each board is to light up all the lights. Your robot understands the following orders: *Order* *Meaning* *Move forward* *Jump forward* *Turn left* *Turn right* *Switch the light* *Call function 1* *Call function 2* 

Please note that this world is not completely suited to small kids since the main difficulty comes from the fact that your are highly limited in the amount of instructions you can give to your robot. Advanced levels thus require to write sound functions, and are often above the capacities of small kids.

This game is heavily inspirated from a flash game of the same name, which can for example be played on kongregate.com. It was written by Danny Yaroslavski (Coolio-Niato), the original idea being of Matt Chase.
