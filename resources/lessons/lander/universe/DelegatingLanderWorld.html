<h2>Lunar Lander</h2>

<p>In this universe you pilot a lunar lander. At each simulation step you're
given the lander's position, speed, angle and thrust and must issue a command
adjusting its angle and thrust.</p>

<h2>Provided functions</h2>

<pre>[!java|c]double [/!]getX()[!scala]:Double[/!]
[!java|c]double [/!]getY()[!scala]:Double[/!]</pre>
Get the X and Y position of the lander.
<pre>[!java|c]double [/!]getSpeedX()[!scala]:Double[/!]
[!java|c]double [/!]getSpeedY()[!scala]:Double[/!]</pre>
Get the horizontal and vertical speed of the lander.

<pre>[!java|c]double [/!]getAngle()[!scala]:Double[/!]
[!java|c]void [/!]setDesiredAngle([!java|c]double [/!]desiredAngle[!scala]:Double[/!])</pre>
Get or set the angle of the lander.<br/>
An angle of 0° denotes a vertical position where the "head" of the lander points up. 
This is the angle you must land with. A positive angle denotes a left-leaning lander, 
a negative angle a right-leaning one. You cannot lean more than by ±90°, and the angle can vary by
at most ±5° in one step.

<pre>[!java|c]int [/!]getThrust()[!scala]:Int[/!]
[!java|c]void [/!]setDesiredThrust([!java|c]int [/!]thrust[!scala]:Int[/!])</pre>
Get or set the thrust of the lander. <br/>You can only 
increment or decrement the thrust by 1 between two simulation steps, so if the 
current thrust is 2 and you ask for 4, you'll only get 3 in the next step. If 
you ask for less than 0 (resp. more than 4), everything will be as if you had 
asked for 0 (resp. 4).

<pre>[!java|c]int [/!]getFuel()[!scala]:Int[/!]</pre>
Get the remaining fuel in the lander.  At each step of the simulation the lander 
consumes as many fuel units as the current thrust. Once you run out of fuel you're 
in free fall so beware!

<pre>[!java]List&lt;Point&gt; [/!]getGround()[! scala]:List[Point][/!]</pre>
Get the vertices of the ground's profile from left to right. 
[!java|scala]You can retrieve the X and Y coordinates of each point
with the corresponding methods of your point: <code>p.x()</code> and
<code>p.y()</code>.[/!]
[!python]Each point is an array of two integers denoting respectively
the X and Y coordinates of that point.[/!]
