<h1>Lunar Lander</h1>

<p>In this lesson you pilot a lunar landing module in increasingly complex
situations.</p>

<p>At each step of the simulation, the player issues a command controlling how
much the angle and thrust of the lander should change</p>

<p>Ideas concerning the progression of exercises:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A lander in vertical position above flat ground, the player can only
control thrust (done)</li>
  <li>A lander in vertical position not above flat ground, the player control
thrust and angle (done)</li>
  <li>A lander with difficult angle and speed not above flat ground, the
player control thrust and angle</li>
  <li>A lander with difficult angle and speed not above flat ground, with
difficult ground, the player control thrust and angle</li>
  <li>Same with wind?</li>
</ul>
