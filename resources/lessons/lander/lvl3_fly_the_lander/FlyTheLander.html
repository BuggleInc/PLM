<h1>Fly the Lander!</h1>

<p>After 30 days of staring at rocks and eating cereals you decide it's time to
go explore other parts of the planet.</p>

<p>You fly for a while and suddenly realize you're almost out of fuel.
Unfortunately you're in a delicate situation and the autopilot is helpless.
You will have to pilot the lander yourself. Your mission is to <b>land the
lander on a flat zone with a vertical speed less than 10 m/s, an horizontal
speed less than 5 m/s and an angle of 0°.</b></p>

<p>You must define two functions: <code>[!java]void [/!]initialize()</code> and 
<code>[!java]void [/!]step()</code>. <code>initialize()</code> is called once just 
after you press "Run". You can use it to chose some flat zone. As before, 
<code>step()</code> is called every 0.1 second and is used for adjusting the 
lander's thrust and angle. As in the first exercise the lander's thrust is adjusted 
via <code>[!java]void [/!]setDesiredThrust([!java]int [/!]desiredThrust[!scala]:Integer[/!])</code>. 
But you can also control its angle via 
<code>[!java]void [/!]setDesiredAngle([!java]double [/!]desiredAngle[!scala]:Double[/!])</code>. 
An angle of 0° denotes a vertical position where the "head" of the lander points up. 
This is the angle you must land with. A positive angle denotes a left-leaning lander, 
a negative angle a right-leaning one. You cannot lean more than by ±90°, and the angle can vary by
at most ±5° in one step.</p>

<p>As in the previous exercise, <code>[!java]List&lt;Point&gt; [/!]getGround()[!scala]:List[Point][/!]</code> returns
the vertices of the ground's profile from left to right. 
Please refer to the documentation (Help/About this world) for a reference manual of your lunar lander.</p>

<p>As before, your program must safely land the lander in all the situations
encountered so far in addition to this new one.</p>

<p>Good luck, try not to crash!</p>
