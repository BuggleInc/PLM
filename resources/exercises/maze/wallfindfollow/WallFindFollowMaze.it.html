<h2>Finding the walls to follow</h2>

<p>This is exactly the same maze than before, but the buggle does not start at
the same location. In particular, it does not have any wall to its left at
the beginning.</p>

<p>As a result, the method you wrote for the previous exercise probably don't
work for this one. If you use it here with no modification, your buggle
probably start looping over the four free cells around its start position
(if that's not the case, well, you didn't really stick to the mission on
previous exercise. Feel lucky and proceed to the next :)</p>

<p>This is because your <code>keepHandOnSideWall()</code> method has an
implicit <b>pre-condition</b>: it works well if and only if the buggle has a
wall to its left when you call it. Such pre-condition are very heavily used
when programming. Specifying them explicitly helps understanding the code
written by other, and they even allow sometimes to prove that the code works
correctly.</p>

<h3>Traguardo dell'esercizio</h3>

<p>
Fixing the problem should be very easy. Simply make sure that the
pre-condition of <code>keepHandOnSideWall()</code> is verified before
calling it. For that, update your code to first look for a wall on its left
before the big <code>while</code> loop.
