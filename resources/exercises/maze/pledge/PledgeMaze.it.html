<h2>Pledge algorithm</h2>

<p>Once again, you thought that your algorithm were good enough to escape the
maze, and once again, you buggle is now in a maze where your previous
algorithm fails. Just give it a try: copy/paste your code and hit the "Run"
button and see your creation fail. The trap is shaped like an upper case
"G". The buggle enters the trap and follows the inner border. At some point,
it finds the north direction free, run into that direction, and falls again
in the trap.
</p>

<p>The Pledge's algorithm (named after Jon Pledge of Exeter) can solve this
maze.</p> 

<p>This algorithm is a modification of the previous one thought to avoid
obstacles. It randomly picks a heading and let the buggle move in that
direction. When it encounters an obstacle, a paw (for example the left one)
is kept on the wall following the obstacle while counting the turns. When
the buggle is back to its original heading and when the sum of the turns is
0, the buggle leaves the obstacle and continues keeping its original
heading. </p>

<p>Note that the use of "total turning" rather than just the "current
direction" allows the algorithm to avoid G-shapped traps. If one proceeds
left into the trap, one gets turned around a full 360 degrees by the
walls. As we said before, the naive "current direction" algorithm gets into
a limit cycle as it leaves the lower rightmost wall heading left and runs
into the curved section on the left again.</p>

<p>The Pledge's algorithm does not leave the rightmost wall due to the total
turning not being zero at that point. It follows the wall all the way
around, finally leaving it heading left on the bottom outside</p>


<h3>Traguardo dell'esercizio</h3>

<p><a name="Objective"/>You now have to modify your solution to implement the
Pledge algorithm to escape this maze.</p>

<p>Change your <code>keepHandOnSideWall()</code> method to count the amount of
turns done by the buggle (+1 when it turns left, and -1 when it turns
right). This counting may require the addition of an <code>angleSum</code>
integer value in your program.</p>

<p>Write a boolean method <code>isDirectionFree(dir)</code> indicating if the
provided direction is free, ie, if you can move in that direction (Note that
the demo uses the NORTH direction for that).  You can retrieve the current
direction of the buggle using the method <code>getDirection()</code>. You
can change your direction (without moving) using
<code>setDirection(dir)</code>. Don't forget to store the previous direction
of your buggle (in a dedicated variable) before checking if your favorite
direction is free in order to restore your state afterward.</p>

<p>You may have to change the rest of your code also, but these changes should
remain limited.</p>

[!python]<p>Don't forget that if you have a method modifying a global variable (such as
angleSum), you should ensure that it declares this variable as
global. Without it, the method creates a new variable of the same name, and
the global never gets modified.</p>
<pre>def myMethod():
  global angleSum
  ...
  angleSum = angleSum + 1
</pre>

<div class="tip" id="tip-1" alt="Show an additional tip">
You should set your direction to your favorite one (NORTH is advised). Then,
you should write the algorithm main loop. In other words, while your buggle
did not find its biscuit, you have to move forward until next obstacle in
the favorite direction. Then, put a paw on a wall (using
(<code>keepHandOnSideWall()</code>) while the sum of turns is not null and
the favorite direction is not free. Do that until you find your baggle.</div>
