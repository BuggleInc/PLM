<h2>La corsa delle quattrò metà</h2>

<p>Here is the second day of the Big Buggles' Race.  As previously, you have to
run forward until you reach the right cell to stop on.  But this time, you
have to reach the cell where the amount of baggles you saw is the double of
the orange cells plus 1.  In other words, the following condition must
become true: <code>2 * baggles = orangeCells + 1</code>.</p>

<p>Potete determinare quando siete su una cella arancione con il metodo
<code>isOverOrange()</code>.</p>
