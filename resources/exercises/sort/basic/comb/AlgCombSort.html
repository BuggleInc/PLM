<h1>CombSort</h1>
 
<p>We saw that CocktailSort improve a bit for turtles (i.e. small values near to
the end of the array), but it is still possible to achieve better. ComboSort
comes down to providing them a short cut: instead of comparing adjacent
values, we compare values separated by a gap bigger than 1. That way,
turtles will traverse <i>gap</i> cells at each traversal. Naturally, we have
to apply the algorithm with decreasing gaps, and finish with <i>gap=1</i> to
ensure that the array is correctly sorted afterward. Choosing the right gap
and how to decrease it is a difficult question, but in practice, dividing it
by 1.3 after each traversal leads to good performance. Here is the
corresponding pseudo-code:</p>
 
 <pre>
gap = len;
do
   if gap>1 then
     gap = gap / 1.3
   i = O
   while i+gap &lt; len do:
     if i and i+gap must be swapped, do it
     increase i by one
while the gap is bigger than 1 or the last traversal swapped at least one pair
</pre>

[!scala]<p>One tricky part is that we want to divide gap, that is an integer (of type Int), by 1.3, that is a Double.
The type system of scala won't let us do this, because such discrepancy usually denotes a programmer error.
As this is not an error this time, we have to convert gap to Double for the time of the operation, 
and then convert the result back to Int to store it into gap. This should be written this way:</p>
<pre>gap = (gap.asInstanceOf[Double] / 1.3).asInstanceOf[Int]</pre>
<p>This is rather verbose, but actually, this notation is not very complex. And remember that the type checker
is your friend. It's picky and sometimes annoying (as on this one), but it often catches weird bugs that
would have been a pain to debug if not catch by the type checker. And since the Scala's authors are pragmatic, 
the previous expression can be simplified:</p>
<pre>gap = (gap.toDouble / 1.3).toInt</pre>
<p><code>toDouble</code> and <code>toInt</code> are just shortcuts for the corresponding expressions 
<code>asInstanceOf[Double]</code> and <code>asInstanceOf[Int]</code>. It's not very generic, but it's very handy.</p>

<p>This algorithm was invented by Wlodek Dobosiewicz in 1980, and later
rediscovered and popularized by Stephen Lacey and Richard Box, who described
it in Byte Magazine in April 1991.</p>
