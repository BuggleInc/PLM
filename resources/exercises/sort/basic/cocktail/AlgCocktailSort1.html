<h1>CocktailSort</h1>

<p>To improve further the BubbleSort algorithm, we need to look closer its behavior. One
can notice that big elements are moved very quickly in position while small
ones move very slowly to their destination. They are thus traditionally
referred to as "rabbits" and "turtles" respectively for big fast values and
small slow ones.</p>

<p>To help the turtles moving faster, the cocktail sort traverse alternatively
the array from right to left and from left to right. Here is the
pseudo-code:</p>

<pre>
Do
  For all i in [0,len-2], do:
    if i and i+1 must be swapped, do it
  For all i in [len-2,0] (downward), do:
    if i and i+1 must be swapped, do it
while at least one of the traversal swapped an element
</pre>

<p>One can see that cocktail sort achieves exactly the same amount of swaps
than the bubble sort, but improves slightly on read amount. It is however
still worse than BubbleSort2 to that extend.</p>
