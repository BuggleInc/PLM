<h1>CocktailSort (take 3)</h1>

<p>Even if the asymptotic complexity of CocktailSort2 is the same than the one
of BubbleSort, it seem to perform better in practice. It is even possible to
improve a bit further by stopping it if the first traversal didn't found
anything to swap, without achieving the downwards traversal. Likewise, we
can stop if the upward traversal found something to swap, but not the
downwards one.</p>
