<h1>Insertion Baseball</h1>

<p>The good point of adapting the selection sort to the baseball problem is that we know that
it works (provided that our adaptation is correct). That's much better than the first naive 
algorithm, that was unable to converge to the solution in some situations. But actually, the 
selection sort is not perfect either as it requires a lot of swaps: we have to bring the hole 
to the selected player and then both the player and hole in position, and more. We can do better.</p>

<p>For example, each player can run quite a long way from its initial position to its target solution.
Instead, it may be more interesting to split the field in two parts: one on the left where all players 
are sorted relatively to each others, and one on the right where the players are still at their initial 
positions. Then, at each iteration, we take the player at the border between the sorted and unsorted 
areas (that is, the left-most player of the unsorted area) and move it to the left (within the sorted 
area) until it reaches its position (that is, until the position where it's bigger that its left
neighbor). This would at least reduce the travel of players to the sorted area as we use the first 
one on the border.</p>

<p>Actually, that's exactly what an insertion sort would do: maintain a sorted area on the left, and put 
iteratively the player on the border to its position within the sorted area. This is good, as we know
that our algorithm is not inherently flawed since we adapt a well known one.</p>     

<p>The easiest to adapt the insertion sort to the baseball problem is to consider all positions as 
adjacent and forget about bases. For that, we define the methods <code>getColor[!c]Insert[/!](pos)</code>, 
<code>move[!c]Insert[/!](pos)</code> and <code>getHole[!c]Insert[/!]()</code> that all use a unique integer to designate a given 
position. These functions simply convert between the way to specify a position and then call the 
usual functions to interact with the world. If you have an <code>index</code> and want to convert it 
into a <code>base,pos</code>, then <code>base=index/2</code> and <code>pos=index%2</code>. To compute 
the reverse, <code>index=base*2+pos</code> (this works because <code>getPositionsAmount()</code> always 
returns 2).</p> 

<p>For the algorithm itself, you should first move the hole to the position 1. The position 0 is 
considered to be the sorted area (of size 1 for now) while the area above 2 is the unsorted area. 
Then comes an iteration to sort each element of the unsorted area. Since this iteration is a bit complex, 
you should think of its loop invariant, that is, the condition that is true before and after the loop 
and which explains that the loop fulfills its goal. Here, the loop invariant is twofold: First, the hole is  
between the sorted area and the unsorted area, and then, the every elements of the sorted area are ... well 
sorted relatively to their neighbors.</p>

<p>Then, the loop body to sort an element should first descend the hole and the elements within the sorted 
area until the element is larger than the element before in the sorted area (2 moves per position to travel), 
and then move the hole back to its position between the sorted and unsorted areas (1 move per position).</p> 

<p>Once you insert the last element within the sorted area, your whole set is sorted and you're done. 
I preserve the surprise of the border cases that will require some little adjustments to your algorithm to 
make it work properly :)</p>
