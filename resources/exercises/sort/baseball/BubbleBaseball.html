<h1>Bubble Baseball</h1>

<p>Crap, we adapted the insertion sort because our selection sort required too much moves to get
the selected players to their position, but the insertion sort requires an inordinate amount of 
changes to get the border elements to their position within the sorted area without mixing the already 
sorted elements. At the end of the day, our selection variant was more efficient with at most 
<code>3*amountOfBase</code> moves to sort one element (1 to get the hole alongside with the player, 
and 2 to get the hole+player in position) while our insertion variant requires at most 
<code>3*amountOfPlayers</code> to sort one element (2 to descend the hole and player in position, 
1 to get the hole back to its position). That's twice as bad as there is two players per base. It may 
be possible to improve the insertion sort by moving by more than one element when descending, but it 
seems uneasy (at least, while not mixing the already sorted elements) and it would probably only 
ensure that our insertion variant becomes as efficient as our selection variant, not dramatically better.</p>

<p>If we cannot make the sort faster, we can make it easier. If you think about it, it seems rather natural
to adapt the bubble sort to this problem: the hole becomes the bubble that moves up and down, sorting a bit 
the array during each traversal. The big lines are simply: "while it's not sorted, move the hole down to base 0 
(moving the biggest player of each base at each step) and then back to the maximal base (moving the smallest 
player of each base)". After a while, <code>isSorted()</code> will return true and your algorithm will stop.</p>

<p>This is so easy that we introduce another variant of the problem, with more than two players per base. 
But actually, that shouldn't block you very long, should it?</p>

<p>Surprisingly, the bubble sort variant requires ways less moves than the other variants. This is astonishing
because usually, the bubble sort performs much worse than the others sorts, but it comes from the very good
match between its big lines and the baseball universe. It actually happens rather often that a pleasantly 
written algorithm performs very decently. But this is not an universal rule either, as demonstrated by the naive 
algorithm of the first exercise, that was nice, simple and wrong ;)</p>
