<h1>Selection Baseball</h1>

<p>The previous algorithm is very pleasant: it's rather simple and rather fast to implement, 
but unfortunately, it is also rather wrong! In some cases, it never stops, which is obviously 
bad. If you don't believe it, just copy paste your previous code, and hit the run button. The 
first world of this exercise is one of these unfortunate situations that drives our previous
algorithm crazy.</p>

<p>So we have to find another algorithm, preferably one that works in all cases.</p>

<p>For that, the best solution is to start from a well known algorithm instead of trying to 
invent a new one from scratch as we just did. When you think a bit about this problem, this 
can is very similar to a sorting problem: Just make sure that the players are sorted by their 
colors and you're set. And while we are at it, let's generalize the game to allow more that 4 
bases.</p>

<p>Let's adapt the selection sort to our situation. The big lines of
the algorithm is then "for each base, select the players that should
occupy this base and make sure that they come to their position". This
way, we will grow an sorted area where all players are already sorted
(and never changed) while the unsorted area shrinks.</p>

<p>Selecting the player should be no problem; Do not hesitate to define some methods such as 
<code>findPlayer()</code> or <code>findPlayerBase()</code>. This will ensure that your code 
remains understandable.</p>

<p>The most problematic aspect is to move the selected players into position. For that, you 
have to move the hole to the position where the player is, and then move both the player and 
the hole to the base that is next to the player's goal (probably in a loop), and finally
put the player in the right position of its target base.</p>

<p>As often in programming, the devil is in the details: there is a bunch of corner cases that
you should detect and deal with correctly, such as the cases where the player is already in the 
base (but not in the position that you would like), or when the hole is on the right of the 
player (probably when you sort the first base). But you will find and hunt these while debugging 
your code.</p>
