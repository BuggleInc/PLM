<h1>Naive Rainbow Baseball</h1>

<p>Today, the buggles decided to play a baseball game, but they are rather out of luck, actually.
First, kinda forgot the rules, and ... well ... they cannot find the ball and bats again. 
So they decided to "adapt a bit" the rules. As the are no ball, the buggles can only running 
around the field, what they do happily: for a while, all attending buggle run at full speed in
all directions around the field.</p> 

<p>But after a few collisions, they decide to invent new rules to organize a bit the game: 
They make one team per base and two players per team. One of the teams has only one player so 
that its base has an empty location. Then, the players are dispatched randomly around the bases, 
and the game for them is to reach their home base. The whole game stops when all players are home. 
There is no winning team: either all players win, or they all lose. Actually, this game is very
different from the original baseball. The only rule that remains is that you can only run around 
the field, from one base to the next one, without crossing middle of the field.</p>

<p>Now, they are asking you to help them deciding who and when should move so that each player 
returns to its base. Only one buggle can move at each round, from its position to the empty spot. 
The maximal distance that a buggle can cover in one round is of one base.</p>

<p>So, at each round, the empty spot is on one base (say <code>B</code>), and you should decide 
which buggle enters that empty spot. There is four candidates (two from base <code>B-1</code> 
and two from base <code>B+1</code>). Actually, there is a fifth candidate since the buggle that 
is on the same base than the empty spot can change its position, but that's not really helping.</p>

<h3>The Na√Øve algorithm</h3>

<p>In this exercise, we will first explore a very simple algorithm. To decide which of the four 
candidate buggles should enter the empty spot, we first restrict ourselves and decide that buggles
can only turn clockwise. Then, from the two remaining candidates, we pick the one that has the 
largest distance to cover to reach its base (turning clockwise). Click on the demo button: this 
works rather well in practice.</p>

<p>It's hard to find a simpler algorithm for this problem: While it's not sorted, search for 
the base containing the candidate buggles: if the hole is in base <code>B</code>, it's the base 
<code>B+1</code>, modulo the amount of bases. Then, compute the distance that each buggle of that 
base still has to run to reach its base (0 if it's already home). Once you found the buggle that 
should enter the empty spot, just use the <code>move</code> method on it, and iterate.</p>   

<p>The main difficulty should be to get the few equations right: determining the base next to the 
hole should be easy, but determining the distance that a player has to cover may reveal a bit more
challenging. Don't hesitate to draw pictures on a paper to cover all possible cases. It should not
be that difficult either: there is not that many cases after all.</p>
