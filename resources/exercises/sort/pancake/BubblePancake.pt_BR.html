<h1>Bubble Pancakes</h1>

<p>Este problema é similar ao anterior: você tem que ordenar as panquecas, a
menor no topo e a maior embaixo, mas você só pode virar elas para
ordená-las.</p>

<p>The purpose here is to sort them using the bubble algorithm, where one
pancake is moved to the bottom until it encounters a bigger one.  In
graphical representations, it looks like a bubble takes the element and move
them through the pile. This is where its name comes from.</p>

<p>Agora, usando panquecas torna as coisas um pouco mais difíceis de escrever,
pois você tem que encontrar uma forma de alternar apenas duas panquecas por
vez.</p> 

<p><div class="tip" id="tip-1" alt="Não compreendi. preciso de ajuda.">
The bubble algorithm consists in browsing the whole pile from top to bottom,
and making a comparision between two pancakes. Each time the top pancake is
bigger than the one below, you have to swap them, then compare the bigger
pancake you just swapped with one below, and so on.  You have to browse
through the entire pile until no swap has occurred, in which case the pile
is sorted.</div>

<p><div class="tip" id="tip-2" alt="A primeira dica não foi suficiente. Preciso de outra.">
If you don't understand the basic bubble sorting algorithm, you should try
the exercises within the "Sorting algorithms" lesson. If you do, but can't
figure a way to swap only two pancakes at a time, think of a situation where
only two pancakes are swapped at a time, and find a way to reach that
situation.
