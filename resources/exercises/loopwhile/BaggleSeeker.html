<h2>Baggle Seeking</h2>
<p>The buggle world can sometimes contain some <i>baggles</i>, which are little
biscuits that buggles can carry from one point to another. For that, they
have to use specific methods such as <code>isOverBaggle(), isCarryingBaggle(), 
pickupBaggle()</code> or <code>dropBaggle()</code>. Click on the button <i>API</i> to check their documentation for more details.</p>

<h3>Exercise goal</h3>

<p>Let each buggle find its baggle by adapting the code you wrote in previous exercise
 (copy/paste what you've done before if you want).</p>
