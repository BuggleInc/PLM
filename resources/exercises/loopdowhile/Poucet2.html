<h2>More buggles tracks</h2>

<p>Hu oh! Your buggle got lost again in the same kind of maze, but this time, the corridors are not 
always of the same size. Since there is no way to know the length of the corridor before taking it,
a <code>for</code> will not suffice anymore. Instead, you will have to change your inner loop to use a 
<code>while</code> loop, using the method <code>crossing()</code> that tells whether your buggle 
currently stands on an intersection.</p>

<p>The extra complexity is that at the beginning of a corridor, you obviously stand on an 
intersection, but you still want to move on.
[!java|scala|c]For that, the easiest is to use a <code>do / while</code> loop instead of 
a regular <code>while</code> loop to move until the next intersection.[/!]
[!python]For that, use an extra variable indicating whether you already entered the
corridor,  as follows. This will ensure that you execute the loop body at least once (when
<code>firstTime</code> is true) before we actually use the value returned by
<code>crossing()</code> to determine to continue or not.[/!]</p>

[!python]
<pre>firstTime = True
while firstTime or not crossing():
  firstTime = False
  (loop body)
</pre>
[/!] 

<p>With that new trick, your buggle should exit this maze quite easily.</p>
