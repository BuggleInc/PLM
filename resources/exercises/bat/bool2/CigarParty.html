<h1>CigarParty</h1>
When
squirrels get together for a party, they like to have cigars. A
squirrel party is successful when the number of cigars is between 40
and 60, inclusive. Unless it is the weekend, in which case there is no
upper bound on the number of cigars. Return true if the party was successful.
