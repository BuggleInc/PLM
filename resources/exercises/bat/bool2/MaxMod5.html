<h1>MaxMod5</h1>
Given two int
values, return whichever value is larger. However if the two values
have the same remainder when divided by 5, then the return the smaller
value. However, in all cases, if the two values are the same, return 0.
Note: the % "mod" operator computes the remainder, e.g. 7 % 5 is 2.
