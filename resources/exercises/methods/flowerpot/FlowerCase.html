<h2>Flower Display Case</h2>

<p>Whao! That's not a little pot anymore! That's a huge large flower display case!
Your buggle can't help but starts flowering this gorgeous place. You should help 
it to prevent that it bumps into a wall...</p>

[!java|scala]<p>As previously, you must write your code in the
<code>growFlowers()</code> method.</p>[/!]

<p>PS: the newly used color is <code>Color.BLUE</code>.</p>
