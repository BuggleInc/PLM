<h2>Methodically drawing (only bigger)</h2>

We will now reproduce an even bigger geometrical drawing. Once again, you
can see the model by clicking on the "Objective" tab.

<p>You can naturally reuse all the code you typed in previous exercise (select
the other exercise, do Ctrl-C, come back to the code of this exercise, do
Ctrl-V).</p>

<p>But you want to keep your code as simple as possible. For that, define new 
methods to deal simply with the repetitions in the pattern. For example, a method
<code>makePattern()</code> achieving the pattern of previous example seems to 
be a good idea (but this may not be enough).</p> 

<p>Why don't you give it a shot? The main code method shouldn't take
more than 2 lines (included in a for loop)</p>
