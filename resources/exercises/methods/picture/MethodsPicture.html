<h2>Colorful drawing</h2>

In this exercise, we will reproduce the geometric drawing that you can see
in the "Objective" tab.

<p>Your goal (here and in any well written program) is to write the simplest
possible code. For that, you have to decompose your work in
sub-steps, and write a specific method for each sub-step.</p>

<p>If you observe carefully the picture to draw, it is constituted of four
parts depicting a sort of V using a different color. A possible
decomposition is to write a method in charge of drawing a V of the specified
color from the current position. Its prototype can be:</p>
<pre>[!java|c]void [/!]makeV([!java|c]Color [/!]c[!scala]: Color[/!])[!python]  <span class="comment"># parameter c is of type Color</span>[/!]</pre>

<p>The <code>Color</code> data type naturally describes a particular
color. Your code should probably call <code>makeV</code> with the following arguments 
(a different color for each call):</p>
<ul>
<li>[!java|scala|python]Color.[/!]YELLOW</li>
<li>[!java|scala|python]Color.[/!]RED</li>
<li>[!java|scala|python]Color.[/!]BLUE</li>
<li>[!java|scala|python]Color.[/!]GREEN</li>
</ul>

<p>In <code>makeV()</code>, you should use the <code>setBrushColor()</code>
method (predefined in the buggle) to change the color of the buggle's brush,
as well as <code>brushUp()</code> and <code>brushDown()</code> to change the
brush position.</p>
 
<p>It may be wise to write the <code>makeV()</code> so that it places directly
the buggle in position for the next V.</p>
 
[!java|scala]
<p>Your turn now. I'm sure you can imagine the other methods you need to keep your code simple and pleasant to read. 
Complete the method <code>run()</code> that should be called automatically (once). 
[!java]the <code>public</code> keyword means more or less that anybody can call this method, which is good because the PLM 
infrastructure calls it directly.[/!] </p>
