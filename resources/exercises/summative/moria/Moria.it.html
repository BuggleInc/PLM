<h2>Persi in Moria</h2>
		
<p>You buggles got stuck in the mines of Moria! Some rocks are blocking the
exit, and you will have to clear your way to the exit. Well of course these
are only baggles and you could simply walk away, but it will be easier to
program the buggles so that they move those "rocks" than convincing them to
walk away without solving the problem. Dwarfs are sometimes really
stubborns...</p>

<p>So, you have to find the first baggle blocking the exit (simply walk to the
east until you are over a baggle), take it and move it back to the other
side of the tunnel (walk to the west while you are not over a baggle, and
then move back one step to the east and drop your baggle), and iterate until
you find the exit (that is, the wall to the east side). Afterward, move out
as in the objective world. That's only a few more steps away.</p>

<p>To make things worse, you have to write a program that works for every
buggle, even if writing a specific program for each of them would be
easier. It seems that using <code>while</code> loops is the only solution to
move the buggles correctly.</p>

<p>Una volta che sarete usciti da questa trappola potrete proseguire con il
prossimo esercizio. Questo esercizio è un po' più complesso e quindi se non
riuscite a risolverlo per ora potrete saltarlo per ritornarci in un secondo
momento.</p>
