<h2>Diagonal Traversal</h2>

<p>This time, you are asked to traverse the world one diagonal after the
other. Have a look at the objective world for more details on the requested
traversal order.</p>
	
<p>You may find useful to use an integer variable <code>diag</code> storing the
number of the diagonal you are traversing.</p>

<p>Your turn...</p>
