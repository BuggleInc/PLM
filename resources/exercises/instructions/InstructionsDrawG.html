<h2>Writing more complex programs</h2>
  Now that we know how to draw things on the board, we'll enjoy this ability and 
  draw a beautiful G on the board (check Objective panel for details on what is 
  expected). 

  <p>When you write a quite complex program, it is sometimes useful to <b>add
   comments</b> to simplify the code reviews afterward. Here for example, it's 
   quite easy to get lost in the drawing process, and you may want to add 
   comments like <i>vertical bar done</i> or <i>finished drawing the G. Time to 
   move back to initial position</i>. Commenting your code is almost mandatory if you 
   (or someone else) want to read it afterward, although over-commenting 
   (describing obvious stuff) is a bad idea as the important idea get lost in the noise.</p>
   
  <p>There is [!java]three[/!][!python|scala|c]two[/!] types of comments in [!thelang], instructing 
  the [!java|scala|c]compiler[/!][!python]interpreter[/!] to not read the text you add for humans:</p>
   
  <ul>
    <li><b>Comments on a single line</b>. When the [!java|scala|c]compiler[/!][!python]interpreter[/!]
      encounters the symbol [!java|scala|c]//[/!][!python]#[/!], it ignores the end of the line.</li>      
    <li><b>Comments on several lines</b>. The [!java|scala|c]compiler[/!][!python]interpreter[/!]
      ignores anything placed between 
      [!java|scala|c]the symbols /* and */ even if they are placed on differing lines.[/!]
      [!python]a line beginning with ''' until the next line ending with '''.[/!]</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="Java">There is a third kind of comments in Java, between /** and */, which are read by a
specific program called JavaDoc to generate automatically the documentation
explaining how to use the code. These comments must follow a very precise
formalism.</p>

  <p class="Python">The comments on several lines are often used to document how to use the code, while others 
  are more used to describe how this code works.</p>
