<h2>Creating Turmites</h2>

<p>This exercise allows you to build your own turmites. To pass the 
exercise, you should simply write a <code>init()</code> method which initializes the <code>rule</code> to 
use the following transitions table (from wikipedia), set the buggle initial position at (8;33), and ask for 8342 steps.</p> 

<table border="1" style="text-align:center">
<tr>
<th rowspan="3" colspan="2"></th>
<th colspan="6">Current color</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<th colspan="3">0</th>
<th colspan="3">1</th>

</tr>
<tr style="font-size:9pt">
<th>Write color</th>
<th>Turn</th>
<th>Next state</th>
<th>Write color</th>
<th>Turn</th>
<th>Next state</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<th rowspan="2">Current state</th>

<th>0</th>
<td>1</td>
<td>R</td>
<td>0</td>
<td>1</td>
<td>R</td>
<td>1</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>1</th>

<td>0</td>
<td>N</td>
<td>0</td>
<td>0</td>
<td>N</td>
<td>1</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>where the direction to turn is one of <b>L</b> (90° left), <b>R</b> (90° right), <b>N</b> (no turn) and <b>U</b> (180° U-turn).</p>

<h2>Going further</h2>
<p>This exercise is naturally an excuse to let you experiment with your own turmites. 
Feel free to change the transition table and the amount of steps to experiment by 
yourself. To that extend, you may find the Ed Pegg Jr's library useful. If you find 
new interesting patterns, send them per email so that we can integrate
them to this list!  </p>

<p>In addition, wikipedia is desperately missing some good looking
colorful turmites: only black and white ones are depicted.  You should
consider submitting your creations directly to the free
encyclopedia.</p>

<p>Here are some 2-color turmites, extracted from http://demonstrations.wolfram.com/Turmites/
[!python|scala]They are not written using the [!thelang] syntax, but converting them should be easy.[/!]</p>

<p>Langton's ants may not share the expressiveness power of the turmites, but they remain 
fascinating too. You can experiment with them using the initLangton() method, provided
in your template, that allows to build a Turmite transition table from a Langton's ant
name. Tiny changes in the ant may result huge changes. For example, "RRL" does not 
seem to lead to any constructed pattern, even after a million steps, but "RLL" starts 
building a very simple highway pattern after less than 100 steps!</p>  

<p>Quite a lot of Langton's ants build highways: RL, of course, but also RLRLRLLRLR (about 2500 steps). 
The chaotic behavior of ants before the highway can be very short (as with RLL that only need 100 steps 
to converge) or very long, as with LLLLLLRRLRRR which seems chaotic for more than 500,000 steps before 
build the highway or even RRLLLRRRLRRR which needs 1170000 to start converging. Some are narrow, and 
others are very large, such as RRLRLLRLRR (200,000 steps). This ant is also notable since it is somehow 
squarish even before the highway start where most others do not show anything notable before their 
highway.<p>

<p>Some ants fill solid sectors, such as RRLLLRLLLRRR (16,000 steps), RRLLLRLLLRRR (30,000 steps), 
RRLLLRRRRRLR (125,000 steps) or RRLRLLRRRRRR (20,000 steps). Some even fill the whole space (RRLRR 
after 3000 steps). Some of my personal favorite ones are the ones where the ant seem to be bouncing 
within a box that gets bigger on each bump, such as LRRRRRLLR (30,000 steps). LRRRRLLLRRR is even 
more impressing since the bounces within the box are regular and since it converges more rapidly to 
its stable behavior (15,000 steps are enough).</p>

<p>Finally, some ants are just build artistic patterns. You should check this video for some beautiful 
ones: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X-gtr4pEBU. If you want to convert them into your code, you have to 
shift them by one: For example, the one depicted at 3:42 is not RRLRLRLLRL, but RLRLRLLRLR (the first visible 
move should be read as last one).</p>

<p>As you can see by exploring the above set of turmites, they are usually not as colorful as the ants, but 
this may be because very few colors suffice to exhibit complex behaviors. For example, there is a specific 
class of turmites called <i>busy beavers</i> which are turmites that write a lot of things before stopping 
(busy beavers are usually classical turing machines, but the idea fits perfectly to turmites too). There is 
a sort of international competition where people strive to find the turmite that covers the biggest area 
before stopping. The web page is here:
