<h2>Langton's ant</h2>

<p>In this exercise, you will turn your buggle into a <i>Langton's
ant</i>. These artificial little animals are very interesting because they
are given simple rules that depend only on their local environment, and
after a period of apparent chaotic behavior, a general pattern
<i>emerges</i>.</p>

<p>The rules are absolutely trivial: to compute what the next step should be,
you should check the current color of the ground (using
<code>getGroundColor()</code>). If it's white, change it to black, turn
right and move forward by one cell. If the ground is currently black, change
it to white, turn left and move forward by one cell.</p> 

<p>It's hard to come up with simpler rules isn't it? Well, let's go and code it
now. You have to complete the <code>step()</code> method, which encodes the
behavior of the ant at each step. You will probably use the
<code>getGroundColor()</code> method to retrieve the color of the cell on
which the ant is currently.  Colors of interest are simply named
<code>Color.black</code> and <code>Color.white</code>.</p>

[!java]
<p>To compare colors, you cannot use the equal signs (==), because these things
are not scalar values but objects. Instead, you need to write something like
the following:</p> 
<pre>
Color c /* = some initialization */;
if (c.equals(Color.black)) {
  /* that's equal */
} else {
  /* that was not equal */
}
</pre>
[/!]

<p>Changing the ground color is not difficult, but a bit long: you have to
change the brush color of your buggle, set the brush down (to mark the
current cell -- with <code>brushDown()</code>), and set the brush back up
(with <code>brushUp()</code>) to avoid further issues when the buggle will
move. You are naturally free of organizing your code the way you want, but
you may want to write a <code>setGroundColor(color)</code> method to
factorize things a bit.</p>

<p>As you can see from the execution of this exercise, the interest in this
algorithm is that after about 10000 steps of relative chaotic behavior, the
ant start building a regular pattern. This emergence of a regular pattern
from the chaos is rather fascinating, isn't it? Move on to the next exercise
to see more of them.</p>
