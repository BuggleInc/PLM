<h2>Turmites</h2>

<p>This exercise explores a new way to extend the concept of Langton's
ant. Now, the behavior of the ant not only depends on the color on the
ground, but also on its internal state (represented by an integer
value). The idea of changing the ant into such an automata naturally comes
from the Turing machine concept. This explains the name of these new
animals, which is a portemanteau of <i>Turing</i> and <i>Termite</i> (if you
don't know what a Turing machine is, you should run to wikipedia, because it
is simply impossible to be a real computer scientist before that).</p>     

<p>Once again, you just have to write the <code>step()</code> method, in charge
of doing one turmite's step. Once again, you should first find the rank of
the current's cell ground color in the color sequence. But this time, the
<code>rule</code> data depends both on the current color and the current
state.  <code>rule</code> actually contains 3 information in each situation:
the color to write, the move to do, and the next state value. For example,
[!java|python]rule[1][0][/!][!scala]rule(1)(0)[/!] contains the informations
to use when <code>state==1</code> and <code>color==0</code>.  In other
worlds, you can retrieve the information relative to your current situation
by using
<code>[!java|python]rule[state][currentColor][/!][!scala]rule(state)(currentColor)[/!]</code>.</p> 

<p>Each such information set contains 3 values. The first one is the rank of
the color to write on the ground. The second is the move to do, with the
following notation: 0=stop, 1=noturn, 2=left, 4=u-turn, 8=right. Note that
if the command is stop, you shouldn't even move forward on that step (but
you shouldn't stop your program either: the next steps can do something else
in a future state). Finally, the third integer is the next
<code>state</code> value to go into after this iteration.</p> 

<p>Since these arbitrary notations are somehow difficult to remember, you
should define a set of constants that you should use instead of the direct
numerical values.  Their names could be NOTURN, LEFT, RIGHT and so on.
[!scala]Just declare them using the keyword <code>val</code> instead of
<code>var</code>.  You should always use <code>val</code> instead of
<code>var</code> when possible anyway.[/!] [!java]The modifiers <code>final
static</code> before their type is the way to mark variables as constant in
Java.  You should write for example <code>static final int NOTURN=1;</code>
Sorry for the complexity of this notation. [/!] [!python]By convention, such
constant variables are written in upper case in python.  Technically, you
can still modify them, but that would be a very bad idea.[/!] You should
write them out of any method so that they are globally visible.</p>

<p>Using such constants greatly help making the code easier to read. Compare
the next two code chunks:</p> 

<pre>[!java]if (rule[state][currentColor][NEXT_MOVE] == LEFT) {[/!][!python]if rule[state][currentColor][NEXT_MOVE] == LEFT:[/!][!scala]if (rule(state)(currentColor)(NEXT_MOVE) == LEFT) {[/!]
    left()[!java];[/!]
[!java|scala]}[/!]</pre>
<p>This is much more easier to read (although longer) than the following:</p>
<pre>[!java]if (rule[i][j][1] == 2) {[/!][!python]if rule[i][j][1] == 2:[/!][!scala]if (rule(i)(j)(1) == 2) {[/!]
    left()[!java];[/!]
[!java|scala]}[/!]</pre>
 
[!python]<p>Finally, you probably want to write a <code>elif</code> branch for the
<code>STOP</code> condition too. Having a <code>else</code> branch
displaying an error message such as "unknown case" is a good practice: it
makes your assumptions about your code more explicit, and you will get an
error message if they fall short. When doing so, the next problem is that
you have nothing to do in the <code>STOP</code> case, but python do not
allows you to write empty <code>elif</code> branches. You should use the
<code>pass</code> instruction as a placeholder: it says python that you have
a branch here, and that it does not contain anything.</p>[/!] [!java|scala]<p>You should probably use a [!java]switch case[/!][!scala]pattern matching[/!]
construct to keep your code readable.  If you can't remember what it is,
check <a href="plm://lessons.welcome/bdr.BDR2">this exercise</a>.</p>[/!]

<p>You now should have enough information to succeed.</p>

<h2>Bibliographical notes</h2>
<p>According to wikipedia, turmites were invented independently by the end of
the eighties. It has been shown that turmites in general are exactly
equivalent in power to one-dimensional Turing machines with an infinite
tape, as either can simulate the other. This means that absolutely any
program that you can think of could theoretically be computed on this
device...</p>
