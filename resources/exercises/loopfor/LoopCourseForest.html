<h2>Outdoor Training Buggle</h2>

<p>Well, our last training didn't went that well. The track actually burned, and we are now banned from there. 
This time, our buggle decided to practice outdoor, in the middle of the forest, with its good old shoes instead.
The problem is that you have to be careful to not fall into water. The track on which you can run is rather narrow:
One side is now 4 steps forward, 2 steps to the left, 4 steps to the right, 2 steps to the right, 4 steps to the left, 
and you want to run 7 around.</p>

<p>Oh crap, running on the grass seems to destroy it too! So just take your 7 loops around the garden, and move along 
to the next exercise before anyone notices the damage you made...</p>
