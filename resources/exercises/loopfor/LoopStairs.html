<h2>Stairway to Heaven</h2>

<p>Your buggle feels a bit depressed today, but it's currently facing a magic stair: 
It leads directly to heaven, and each time you walk on it, joyful colors spur all around.</p>

<p>Your goal is to take this stair, one step after the other. 
First devise the four instructions you have to give you buggle to take one stair step, 
and then put them in a loop to take the whole stair.</p>

<p>Before that, walk a bit forward to reach that stair, and ensure that you are in 
the right situation for your loop content to run properly. And once you reach the heaven, 
take some steps in your new home. 
Meanwhile, you just have to walk your way, the colors appear automagically.</p>
