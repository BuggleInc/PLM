<h2>Welcome to the PLM</h2>

<p>The goal of this first exercise is to instruct your buggle to move forward
by one step. Switch between the views on the right for more
info. <i>World</i> depicts the world as it is now, while <i>Objective</i>
depicts what you should get.</p>

<h3>My <i>buggle</i>? What is this??</h3>

<p>Buggles are little animals obeying any order you may give them. Currently,
you must use the [!thelang/] programming language for that, but you can
change the language from the menu, or by clicking the icon in the status
bar.</p>

<h3>How to proceed?</h3>
  
<p>Write your program in the "Code" pane. It should read as follows:</p>
 <pre>[!java|scala|python]forward()[!java];[/!][/!][!c]stepForward();[/!]</pre>
[!java|c]<p>Não esqueça do <code>;</code> final que diz ao compilador que a instrução
está encerrada (sim, o computador é tão bocó que ele não consegue
<i>adivinhar</i> coisas óbvias como isto).</p>[/!]
 
<p>Once done, click on Run to execute your code.</p>

<p>If your code contains errors, that's perfectly OK: Even talented programmers
struggle on their code.  The computer will display error messages in the
console to help you fixing them. These messages may sound scary at first
glance, but don't panic. The compiler is only somehow limited in its
communication abilities, but it's not mean. If you look closer, the solution
to solve your issue is written somewhere in those cryptic messages. You will
see, with a bit of habit, we get used to it.</p>
