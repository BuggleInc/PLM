<h2>Welcome to the PLM</h2>

<p>The goal of this first exercise is to instruct your buggle to move
forward by one step. Switch between the views on the right for more
  info. <i>World</i> depicts the world as it is now, while 
<i>Objective</i> depicts what you should get.</p>

<h3>My <i>buggle</i>? What is this??</h3>

<p>Buggles are little animals obeying any order you may give
them. Currently, you must use the [!thelang/] programming language
for that, but you can change the language from the menu, or by
clicking the icon in the status bar.</p>

<h3>How to proceed?</h3>
  
<p>Write your program in the "Code" pane. It should read as follows:</p>
 <pre>[!java|scala|python]forward()[!java];[/!][/!][!c]stepForward();[/!]</pre>
[!java|c]<p>Do not forget the final <code>;</code> which tells the compiler that the
instruction is over (yes, computers are so dumb that they cannot <i>guess</i> 
obvious stuff like this).</p>[/!]
 
<p>Once done, click on Run to execute your code.</p>

<p>If your code contains errors, that's perfectly OK: Even talented
programmers struggle on their code.  The computer will display error
messages in the console to help you fixing them. These messages may
sound scary at first glance, but don't panic. The compiler is only
somehow limited in its communication abilities, but it's not mean. If
you look closer, the solution to solve your issue is written somewhere
in those cryptic messages. You will see, with a bit of habit, we get
used to it.</p>
