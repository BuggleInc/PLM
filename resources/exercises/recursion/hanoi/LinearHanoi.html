<h2>Linear Towers of Hanoi</h2>

<p>This is a classical variation over the Towers of Hanoi where some moves are forbidden.
Specifically, disks cannot move directly between the left-most and the right-most pegs. 
The middle peg must be involved in every moves.</p>

<p>Beside of that extra complexity, the problem remains unchanged: you are requested to 
move the whole stack of disks from one extremity peg to the other one. You can only move 
one disk at a time, and a bigger disk cannot be placed over a smaller one.</p>

<p>As with the classical version, it is much easier to produce a recursive solution, and 
you are absolutely able to devise this solution if you think hard enough about it.</p>

<div class="tip" id="tip-1" alt="I tried, but I don't get it">
The standard recursive algorithm for classical Hanoi is of complexity <i>2^n-1</i> 
where the standard recursive algorithm for this variation is of complexity <i>3^n-1</i>.
</div>

<div class="tip" id="tip-2" alt="That first tip was not enough">
The standard recursive algorithm for classical
Hanoi involves two recursive calls sandwiching one
movement of the largest disk, the standard
recursive algorithm for Linear Hanoi involves three
recursive calls sandwiched around two movements of the same disk.
