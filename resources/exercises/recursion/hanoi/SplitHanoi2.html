<h2>Better Split Towers of Hanoi</h2>

<p>Surprisingly, our solution to split the towers generates much more
moves than our solution to interleave them. As both problems are symmetric, this should not be.</p>
<table border="1">
<tr><td>Disks amount</td><td>Interleaved</td><td>Split</td></tr>
<tr><td>5 pairs</td>     <td> 62 moves</td>  <td> 88 moves</td></tr>
<tr><td>6 pairs</td>     <td>126 moves</td>  <td>183 moves</td></tr>
<tr><td>7 pairs</td>     <td>254 moves</td>  <td>374 moves</td></tr>
</table>

<p>Can you make the split tower as efficient as the interleaved one?</p>

The source of discrepancy is an inefficient problem decomposition. 
Satisfied that it merely worked, we looked no futher for a better solution.
Keeping the disks of the interleaved tower in the correct order during every move is unnecessary.
In fact, we can avoid moving the interleaved tower at all.
A better problem decomposition splits the pair of disks into two colored towers as they are removed from the interleaved tower.

If someone could split the (n-1) pairs of disks beforehand, could you
split the remaining pair?

<div class="tip" id="tip-3" alt="You need to be more explicit">
<ul>
 <li>First split the first (n-1) pairs of disks from the interleaved stack into a white tower and a black tower (calling recursively your main function).</li>
 <li>Then move the large white disk on its target pole.</li>
 <li>Then move the (n-1) smaller white disks on top of the large one.</li>
 <li>Then move the large black disk on its target pole.</li>
 <li>Then move the smaller black disks in position.</li>
</ul>
