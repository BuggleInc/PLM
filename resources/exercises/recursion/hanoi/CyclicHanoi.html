<h2>Cyclic Towers of Hanoi</h2>

<p>This variation of the Towers of Hanoi is very similar to the
regular problem: you are given one stack of disks and three pegs, and you cannot move a larger disk over a smaller one.
The change is that you can only move disks clockwise: 0->1 or 1->2 or 2->0, but never in the other direction.</p>

<p>Obviously, the movements are not symmetric anymore. Moves from A to B are now very different from moves to B to A.
As a result, you need two recursive functions depending on whether you are moving the stack clockwise or counterclockwise.</p>

<p>That being said, the problem decomposition is very similar to the
classical Hanoi. The twist is that each function call the other one, 
constituting a nice example of mutual recursion.</p>
