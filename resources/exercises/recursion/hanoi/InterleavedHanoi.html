<h2>Interleaved Towers of Hanoi</h2>

<p>In this classical variation of the Towers of Hanoi, you are given 4 pegs with 2 stacks, 
one white and one black. You should mix the two stacks as depicted in the Objective world. 
As previously, you cannot move a disk on a smaller disk.</p>

<p>You will probably need to reuse the <code>hanoi()</code> method that you wrote in the previous exercise.</p>

then you have the following situation right before the main recursive call:<br/>
