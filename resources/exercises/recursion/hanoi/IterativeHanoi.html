<h2>Iterative Towers of Hanoi</h2>

<p>In this last exercise of the series, we will implement an iterative algorithm
for the base problem of the Towers of Hanoi (one stack, 3 pegs, no extra movement 
restriction). </p>

<p>This algorithm is actually very simple: On odd moves, the smallest disk is moved 
in a given direction (either increasing 0-&gt;1-&gt;2-&gt;0 or decreasing
2-&lt;1-&lt;0-&lt;2) while on even moves, the only possible move that does not imply the 
smallest disk is made. You stop as soon as the stack is rebuilt on another location.</p> 

<p>The function that you now need to write takes two parameters: the initial position of the 
smallest disk (i.e., the peg initially containing the stack) and a boolean indicating whether 
the smallest disk should move in the increasing order or not.</p>

<p>The simplicity of this algorithm is actually almost deceiving. One could wonder on the 
interest of the recursive algorithms when such a simple iterative algorithm exists. My personal 
feeling is that this solution is nice to execute, but almost impossible to devise in the first
place (I even suspect that the authors built this iterative solution from observations of the
recursive execution)...</p>

<p>Predicting the effect of this function is also
difficult: When the small disk moves in the increasing order, the stack is reconstructed on the
right peg with 5 disks but on the left with 6 disks.</p>

<p>An interesting question is whether such simple iterative algorithms exist for the other 
variation of the problem. Some were given in the literature (e.g. for
the cyclic variation). I would happily integrate your solutions to the
PLM, especially if you can hint (without spoiling) the solution to guide the next ones.</p>
