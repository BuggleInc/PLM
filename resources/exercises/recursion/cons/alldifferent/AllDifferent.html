<h1>All Different</h1>
Given a [!scala]List[Int][/!][!java|python]recursive list[/!], return true if any two elements of the 
list are different (ie, if no element appears more than once in the list).

<p>The simplest solution is in O(nÂ²), meaning that it runs in quadratic time. 
You will probably have to define one extra function for that. 
Another much more complex solution runs in O(n log(n)).</p>
