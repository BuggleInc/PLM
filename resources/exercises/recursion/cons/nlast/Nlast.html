<h1>Nlast</h1>
Given a [!scala]List[Int][/!][!java|python]recursive list[/!] and an integer <code>N</code>, 
return the list with only the <code>N</code> last elements.

<p>Your solution should be linear in time, but you will probably need to define several functions to achieve that complexity.</p>

<div class="tip" id="tip-1" alt="I cannot do it in linear time">
The trick is to compute only once (and beforehand) how many elements you should keep.
