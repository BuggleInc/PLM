<h1>Reverse</h1>
Given a [!scala]List[Int][/!][!java|python]recursive list[/!], return a new list with all elements in reverse order. 

<p>This function is very important and you should not pass that challenge. 
Your solution should be linear in time, with the help of helper functions.</p>

<div class="tip" id="tip-1" alt="I cannot do it in linear time">
You need an helper function in which the result is accumulated (built) at each step.
