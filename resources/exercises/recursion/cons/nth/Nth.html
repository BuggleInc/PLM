<h1>Nth</h1>
Given a [!scala]List[Int][/!][!java|python]recursive list[/!] and an integer <code>N</code>, 
return the <code>N</code>th element of the list.

<p>You can assume that the list is long enough, i.e. that there is at least <code>N</code> elements. 
Your solution should be linear in time.</p>
