<h1>Concat</h1>
Given two [!scala]List[Int][/!][!java|python]recursive list[/!] <code>l1</code> and <code>l2</code>, 
return a new list with all elements of <code>l1</code> followed by the elements of <code>l2</code>. 

<p>Your solution should be linear in time, but you will probably need to define several functions to achieve that complexity.</p>

<div class="tip" id="tip-1" alt="I cannot do it in linear time">
You need to modify <code>l1</code> beforehand so that the computations at each step of the recursion are in constant time.
