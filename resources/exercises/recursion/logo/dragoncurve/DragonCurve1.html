<h2>Dragon curve (1)</h2>

<p>The dragon curve is a classical example of recursive method.</p>

<p>The definition of this curve is the following:<br/> 
the dragon curve of order 1 is a vector between to arbitrary points P and Q,<br/>
the dragon curve of order n is the dragon curve of order n-1 between P and
R, followed by the same curve of order n-1 between Q and R,
where PRQ is an isosceles triangle with angle R being a right angle, and R
being at the right of the PQ vector. Thus, if P and Q coordinates are (x, y)
and (z, t), the coordinate (u, v) of R are given by:</p>
<pre>
u = (x + z)/2 + (t - y)/2
v = (y + t)/2 - (z - x)/2
</pre>

<p>The prototype of the method drawing the curve is the following:</p>
<pre>[!java|c]void [/!]dragon([!java|c]int [/!]order[!scala]:Int[/!], [!java|c]double [/!]x[!scala]:Double[/!], [!java|c]double [/!]y[!scala]:Double[/!], [!java|c]double [/!]z[!scala]:Double[/!], [!java|c]double [/!]t[!scala]:Double[/!])</pre>


<p>You should use the method <code>setPos(x,y)</code> to put your turtle at
coordinates (x,y) and the method <code>moveTo(z,t)</code> to draw a line
between the turtle position and the point(z,t).</p>

<p>Have a look at each world's objective view to understand how to write the
function.</p>
