<h2>Snow pentagon</h2>

<p>Here comes yet another variation of the Koch curve. This time, we grow little pentagons 
(ie, polygons with five sides each). I'm sure you get it now.</p> 

<p>Another difference with earlier is that the length is not divided by three at each step anymore, 
but multiplied by 0.4. The curve looks better this way :)</p> 

<p>We draw only one side in this exercise so your code will be called only once this time.</p>
