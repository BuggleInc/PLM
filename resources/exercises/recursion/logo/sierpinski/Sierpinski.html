<h2>Sierpinski's Triangle</h2>

<p>The fractal we will now draw is formed of a big triangle inside which
several smaller triangles are embedded. The prototype of the function to draw
it is the following:</p>
<pre>[!java|c]void [/!]sierpinski([!java|c]int [/!]level[!scala]:Int[/!], [!java|c]double [/!]length[!scala]:Double[/!])</pre>

<p>Have a look at each world's objective view to understand how to write the function. 
To draw one side of the triangle, draw a smaller recursive triangle (halve the length) and move forward by the requested length. 
Globally, you have to draw 3 such sides and turn by 120 between each side.</p>
