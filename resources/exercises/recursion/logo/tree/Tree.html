<h2>Trees</h2>

<p>We will now draw trees. For that, we will write a method using double
recursion following this prototype</p> 
<pre>[!java|c]void [/!]tree([!java|c]int [/!]steps[!scala]:Int[/!], [!java|c]double [/!]length[!scala]:Double[/!], [!java|c]double [/!]angle[!scala]:Double[/!], [!java|c]double [/!]shrink[!scala]:Double[/!])</pre>

<p>To draw a tree of four levels, you have to draw a trunk of the given length,
turn right of the given angle, draw a tree of level 3, turn left twice of
the given angle, draw another tree of level 3, and come back to your initial
location. Don't forget to come back to the initial location!<p>

<p>If a tree's trunk is of length 'len', the trunk of the next level tree will
be of length 'len*shrink'.<p>

<p>At the end, here is the pseudo-code of the general case (you should add the base case yourself):</p>
<pre>
  Move forward of the desired length
  Draw (recursively) the right subtree
  Draw (recursively) the left subtree
  Move back to your initial position
</pre> 
<p>Don't forget to add the base case to your code, or your buggle will enter an infinite loop. 
Then, drawing the right subtree comes down to turn right and then draw the subtree.</p>

<p>As you can see, each recursion level is represented by a distinctive color. For that, you have to call the 
<code>current(step)</code>, passing the current recursion level as a parameter. This will pick the right color for you.
Don't erase your great colors when you move back to your initial location.</p>

<p>If you get your function wrong, this can easily become hairly to debug as your 
errors will appear at each level of the recursion, completely changing the drawing.
For debugging purpose, you can use the <code>subtree()</code> that will draw a correct 
subtree. This function is then very similar to the one you are trying to write. The only difference 
is that <code>subtree()</code> only draws in black. So, you can use it instead of a recursive call 
to debug your code, but you have to change for a proper recursive call to your own code (once it works) 
to get the colors right, and pass the exercise.</p>
