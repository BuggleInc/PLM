<h2>Drawing spirals</h2>

<p>This exercise is not really an exercise in that sense that you just have to click on the 
Execute button to get the reward: All the needed code is already provided. Instead, you can 
here explore the possibilities of the code you just wrote by changing the parameters of the call 
to the <code>spiral</code> function. You can move on to the next exercise if you are short on time, 
and come back later to play around.</p>

<p>Here are some of the figures that you can produce with your <code>Spiral</code> function, provided 
that you come with the right parameters. You can switch to the creative mode (from the Exercise menu) 
to disable the world comparison when you explore with these spirals.</p>

<img src="exercises/recursion/logo/spiral/example-2.png"/> <!-- spiral(5,360/5,100,0) -->
<img src="exercises/recursion/logo/spiral/example-3.png"/> <!-- spiral(5,2*360/5,150,0) -->

<img src="exercises/recursion/logo/spiral/example-4.png"/> <!-- spiral(360,1,1,0) -->

<p>If you discover a cool figure, don't forget to send your parameters (menu Help/feedback) so 
that we can add it to the list!</p>
