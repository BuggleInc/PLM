<h1>Maximal value</h1>

<p>In this exercise, you must compute the maximal value contained in an array. 
For that, fill the <code>maximum()</code> method, which parameter is 
the array to explore.</p>

<p>To compute this value, sweep over the whole parameter. For each value, if it's 
bigger than the biggest value you saw so far, you must save this value somewhere to 
remember it afterward. You thus need an extra variable, which can be initialized to 
the value of the first array cell.</p>
