<h1>Maxima and Minima</h1>

In this exercise, you must return the difference between the maxima
(i.e., the largest value of the array) and the minima (i.e., its
smallest value). The returned value is then a positive number.

Beware, you can only do one traversal of the array to gather all
informations that you need.
