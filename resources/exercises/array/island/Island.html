<h1>Buggles' Island</h1>

You just received the traveling notes of your old aunt who traveled
accross the country of the Buggles' Islands. She wrote down the
altitude every kilometer during her trip, resulting in a sequence of
numbers as follows.

<pre>0 0 1 1 2 2 1 1 0 1 2 2 1 1 0</pre>

<p>Here is a cut of the islands on that path:</p>

<pre>
       /***\       /*\         &lt;-- 2 meters above the see level
   /***********\ /*******\     &lt;-- 1 meter above the see level
***************************    &lt;-- see level
| | | | | | | | | | | | | |
0 0 1 1 2 2 1 1 0 1 2 1 1 0    &lt;-- altitude on each point
</pre>

<p>This example is constituted of four levels of island:</p>

<ul>
  <li>1 1 2 2 1 1 (the island on the left)</li>
  <li>2 2 (the mountain topping the left island)</li>
  <li>1 2 1 1 (the right island)</li>
  <li>2 (the mountain on the right)</li>
</ul>

<p>This can also be visualized this way:</p>

<pre>0 0(1 1(2 2)1 1)0(1(2)1 1)0</pre>

<p>Could you write a little program to compute the amount of levels in
a given sequence of altitudes? Actually, there is an iterative and a
recursive solution to that problem.</p>
