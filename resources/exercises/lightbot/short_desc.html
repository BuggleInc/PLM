<h3>LightBot</h3>

<p>This lesson constitutes a little brain teaser for programmers. You
have to instruct your robot to turn off all lights. The trick is that
you program your robot graphically, and that you are limited in the
amount of instructions.</p>

<p>No previous experience is expected to take this lesson.</p>
